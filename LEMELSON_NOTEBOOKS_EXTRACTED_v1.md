January 28, 1959 To whom it may concern On this date, January 28, 1959 I visited
Kaysam Corporation, Paterson, N.J. My former employer with the intent of
determining if they would be helpful to me in producing models of squeeze and
novelty toy ideas I have consented for products made of dry molded latex and/or
rotational or slush molded vinyl or the like. The basic ideas which I sketched
and described to both Carl Hotstein and Abe Duncan are hereby recorded primarily
because, after describing them to Duncan, he discussed my problem with Mr.
Ernest Gelles, president of the company without asking me if he should do so. He
told me that he had informed Gelles that I had some new ideas in squeeze toys
but did not go into the exact details. However, Carl Hotstein later remarked to
me that Abe Duncan cannot be trusted to maintain confidence. Basically the
designs evolve about a toy having a central body member or portion made out of a
dipped latex bellows, bellows or a rotational or slushed molded bellows portion.
A design is illustrated on page 7 consists of a toy (squeeze novelty, crib or
play toy) having a body with three portions, an upper body portion 12, a central
body portion 14 which is shaped like a bellows which extends at its lower end to
a lower body portion 16 or stand which may be molded integral with 14 or secured
thereto the tower end of 14 or of 16 may be secured to a Lenore Waldmeyer Jan

clamp, suction cup or other device for securing it to a surface, railing or part
of a crib or handle. The bellows is of such a characteristic that it will
ordinarily remain in the expanded state and support the upper body portion 12
but may be easily deflected to collapse or squeeze together and create a noise
by expelling air thru an opening 18 (such as at the bottom wall) having a
noisemaker therin. Reference is may to my copending application entitled
noisemaking Toys and particularly to Figs. 20 and 21 for details of this
construction in the fabrication of a bellows noisemaker. Jerome Lemelson Jan 28

August. 4. 1959 Record of Conception: The following product and packaging ideas
will be incorporated into patent application and will, in the coming months, be
delivered to Johnson and Johnson. I. Brush Covering - This was conceived a
number of years ago and the patent specification (first draft) worked out last
winter. It consists of several novel designs for ~~ pla ~~ covers for the
bristles or tufts of various types of brushes. The covers are preferably molded
of plastic and snap over or screw onto a formed section of the brush base
adjacent the bristle. II. Single Shot (liquid, cream, or powder) Dispensers It
has been conceived by me to provide a low cost dispenser or package for flowable
material for possibly for a single application of a liquid such as an
antiseptic, nose drops, face cream, ointment, burn salv oil (baby oil, ~~ it ~~
machine oil), medicine (spray), ~~ or the like ~~ powder or the like. These
dispensers are preferably made of plastic (from 2 heat sealed sheets (.001 to
.005 " thick) or thin walled tubing Conceived designs as follows

Fig.1 and 2 illustrates one form of the invention which comprises a package or
closure which is made from sheet material and is adapted for the rapid ~~ and ~~
dispensing of a predetermined quantity of a flowable material such as a liquid,
cream or powder. The closure is preferably made of a flattened tube or two
sheets of plastic material, metal foil or laminates Read & UNDERSTOOD By J.B.

of the two and consists of a pouch 12 in which said flowable material is
hermetically sealed, which pouch is fabricated and filled preferably by
automatic machinery from the flattened plastic tube 10 or assembly of abutted
sheets of foil or plastic material. The pouch portion 12 is shown having an
enlarged reservoir section 14 for storing most if not all of the contents which
extends to an elongated section or neck 16 of substantially smaller
cross-section than 14. The neck portion 16 ~~ serves ~~ may be provided for
dispensing the contents of 12 and ~~ may be used used for dispensing the ~~
control of the direction of flow of said contents which will flow therethru when
the pouch section 14

is squeezed between the fingers ~~ and ~~ after the wall of the neck is torn or
penetrated. ~~ to perm The illustrated pouch 12 is made from a length 11 of the
material comprising the elongated strips or tube 10 which length may be severed
therefrom after the formation and filling of 12 or may ~~ l ~~ remain ~~ in ~~
as part of a predetermined length of 10 containing a plurality of said pouch.
Formations in tandem array. The notation 24 refers to a perforation or partial
die-cut, extending laterally across 10, which may be provided to permit the
sections 11 to be severed from the rest of the strip when needed for use. A
strip heat-seal or weld 18 extends around the pouch ~~ formation ~~ 12 which
effects the formation of the pouch. The notation 18a refers to that portion of
the seal extending around the reservoir portion 14 of the pouch and 18b to the
sealing line extending adjacent the neck portion 16. Filling the pocket with
material may be effected ~~ thru ~~ across the area of the seal such as at the
end 18c' of 18c which Read & Understood by Jacob B. Gilstein Sept. 5, 1959

### Page 7
may be left open after sealing portions 18a, 18b and 18c are formed. A filling
nozzle may be automatically inserted across 18c  18c' into the neck 16 or across
any other portion of the seal 18 after which the liquid is injected, the nozzle
removed and the area (18c') automatically welded or sealed off. ~~ Hee ~~ If it
is desired to utilize the closure 12 for dispensing a small quantity and/or
predetermined amount of a liquid or cream into a cavity such as the ~~ nose ~~
nostril, the nose portion 16 is preferably provided narrow enough to effect said
insertion and the material of 10 on both sides of 16, referred to by the
notation 10a and 10b, is preferably removed by die-cutting. A semi-circular
die-cut such as 22 may suffice to provide 16 in a small enough cross-section for
insertion into its intended cavity. To dispense the material held in 12, the
wall thereof must be severed and this may be accomplished in one of several
manners. While the end of nose 16 may be cut off with an implement such as a
scissors, if the container is to be carried on a person for use when the need
arises, it is preferable that a simpler method of opening the nose wall be
provided. Quick opening may be effected in one of a number of manners. The ~~
melt ~~ opening means illustrated in Fig. 11 utilizes the tearing of the
material of one wall of 16 by means of a tear strip 20 which is a narrow band of
flexible or rigid plastic, 3/32 to 1/4 inches wide, which preferably has a
tensile strength greater than that of the material of the wall of 16. In Fig. 1
the tear strip 20 is shown welded or heat sealed to the outer surface of ~~ the
~~ one wall of 16, which weld is provided in a manner such that when the tear
strip is pulled upward from 16 or longitudinally relative to 16, a small Read

tear-opening at the weld ~~ 18c' ~~ 20w will be effected in the wall of 16 thru
which the contents of 12 may be forced by squeezing the walls of 14 together
between the fingers and/or by gravity. The tear strip 20 may be applied across
each nose formation as a continuous strip of material by means of respective
spot welds 2OW applied with ~~ a ~~ ~~ s ~~ heated dies or electronic heat
sealing dies which welds may be effected prior to or after the formation of the
enclosures (i.e. ~~ prior to o ~~ by spot welding the strip 20 to one wall of
the container or across both walls of the neck portion 16, which would tack the
walls of the neck portion together. The notation 20c refers to respective cuts
in the tear strip material which provide it in a plurality of sections, one for
each of the closure formations. The closures 12 may be individually severed from
the strip 10 along the lines indicated at 12 ~~ by ~~ or may be torn therefrom
as used if it is desired to provide the closures in an elongated strip or in a
roll formation. The provision of perforations or scores in the sheets along line
24 will facilitate severing the individual lengths of material by tearing.
Further variations in the closure design include:

distance beyond the end of 16. The tubing may be closed at one end (the outer)
and when its walls are broken, the liquid  welding  may be made to flow

Electric Razor Design Monitone Universal HOLLOW TUBULAR CYLINDER Oct. 9, 1959

Fig. 1 Figs 1 illustrates in partial cross-section details of the improved
electric razor head in partial cross-section. The razor 10 has a molded plastic
casing 12 of conventional design and made in two or more parts assembled with
fasteners with internally mounted components secured to said housery and
consisting of a rechargable battery 27 which is electrically connected thru an
externally operative switch 30 to a d.c. motor 25 for operating the cutting
components of the razor. The shaft 25' of motor 25 is coupled to a gear train 24
having an output or drive gear 24'. The motor, battery and gear train are ~~
separded from ~~ secured is separated from the head section 11 of the razor by
means of a wall or partition 26. Cutting is accomplished by means of a rotary
cutter 22 which is a thin walled cylinder, preferably made from stainless steel
~~ or ~~ tubing having a wall thickness less than .015 inches. Force filled into
the end portions of the cyclinder 22 are shaft pins 16 and 21. The ends of these
pins are supported in rotational bearing by means of bearings 15 and 20 which

Gilstein Nov 1, 1959 Record of Conception Some time prior to this date I have
conceived of the method and apparatus for providing printed decorations on blow
molded plastic articles by printing on the sheet or sheet of plastic from which
the article is made, then heating it to ~~ near ~~ formable state as it feeds
between mold halves without destroying printing, registering it in adjacent mold
halves and closing mold halves when in registration while blowing the sheets
outward with air. The printing may be effected on either those surfaces which
form the inside or outside of the article. A photoelectric relay scanning the LW
11/13/59 EJW 11/13/59

printing (positional marks) may be used to effect longitudinal registration of
printed matter. Jerome H Lemelson

### Page 12
Nov 6, 1959 Concerning the above idea, an edge line or lines ~~ scann ~~ printed
on the sheet or sheets of plastic to be blow molded may be used for lateral
registration. The correction of the position of a photoelectric cell (error
signal derived in change in position when ~~ fo ~~ the motor driving the mount
for the cell laterally to maintain it in alignment with said line) may be used
to shift either the means guiding the sheets to align it with the mold or shift
the mold in a lateral position so that the printed matter on the sheet will be
exactly registered in the molded product. To protect the printed matter from
distortion when the sheet is blown into the mold, it may be provided between the
surface of one or both sheets. One method of providing it between surfaces is to
coat or laminate the same or other (sheet) material on the printed surface of
the sheet or to provide said printed illustration on the inside surface of the
sheet laminated thereto. Another method is to utilize a sheet of plastic in
white a photographic image has been reproduced and blow mold this material after
carefully heating to semi-molten state. Here are several article ideas which
together with the above, I intend to file patent application on. Imitation
Stained Glass Window

The window 1 and possibly the frame or part of the frame is made of a lamination
of ~~ a lamination ~~ of a first plastic sheet 2 (may be rigid vinyl on the
thermostatic) (over) LW 11/13/59 EJW 11/13/59

### Page 13
.025 to .010 inches in thickness having a second sheet 3 (~~ .0005 to .002"
thick)of a highly durable plastic material such as polyvinyl fluoride bonded and
laminated to the outside surface of 1, the outer surface 3' of 3 being that
which is exposed to the atmosphere. A multi-colored transparent or translucent
design (simulating a stained glass window pattern) may be provided at the
interface 4 between 2 and 3 by printing with translucent or transparent ink on
either the inside face of 4 or the outside face of 2. The notation 2b refers to
a vacuum  or ? ~~ formed or molded ridge formation in the sheet 2 or assembly 1
simulating the metal joining the sections of stained glass and the illustration
4" printed at the interface 4 is preferably black material to simulated the iron
metal which joins sections of stained glass in a window frame. The inside
surface 2' of 2 may or may not be coated with a protective plastic layer such as
acrylonitrile plastic or PVT film itself The above lamination and decorative
means may be applied to windows of any design  and it is conceived that many new
and interesting shapes may be provided. For example, the ribbed formation 2b may
have different shapes and may be limited in its length. It may represent a jewel
sch as a ruby or saphire (its shape being integrally molded or vacuum formed and
color being derived by printng on the inside face 2' of 2, or at the interface 4
between 2 and 3, either on the inside of 3 or outside of 2. A structure is
conceived for a lenticular display sign to be used out of doors ref. being made
to my LW 11/13/59 EJW 11/13/59

pending applications "DISPLAY DEVICE" and display and Manufacture Thereof" viz.

The display at right consists of a laminated assembly 1 of a rigid (or flexible)
base sheet 2 of any suitable plastic, metal or lamination. An assembly 3 or
lamination of several sheets is preferably hermetically secured or bonded with
an adhesive to one surface of 2 and consists of a lenticular or ribbed sheet 4
of transparent plastic having a multiplicity of semi-cylindrical formations or
ribs 4 formed by extrusion or molding or vacuum forming in one surface thereof
(may also be semi-spherical or the like) Bonded to the outside (ribbed) surface
of 4 is a transparent sheet or film of a durable plastic such as polyvinyl
fluoride (preferably .001 inches or .0005" to .0001" thick depending on shape of
ribs 4) which protects outer surface of (rigid vs flexible viny chloride)sheet 4
from abrasion or weathering. Bonded to other surface of 4 is a second sheet 3'
of P.V.F. or other material, there being the desired multi-pattern display
printed at the interface 3" either on surface of 3' or 4. The sheet 3' may also
be Scotch Lite material or may be eliminated if base sheet 2 (.03 to .250"
thick) has illustration thereon or is hermetically laminated to 4 which base
sheet may be sheet of Scotch Lite The following method of packaging springs
(coil or other) has been conceived by me. It is conceived to guide the short LW

length of coil spring as or just after its formation and exit from the wire coil
or bending machine and to deposit it directly onto an elongated sheet of folded
paper or plastic to which it is secured or against which it is held (and
prevented from becoming entangled with other springs). ~~ and thereby ~~ If the
plastic strip is wrapped or folded around the springs (in a tube-like formation)
or a second sheet of plastic or paper is secured or bonded over the first sheet
or strip with the spring there between, then the tubular-like formation may be
rolled into coils and present the springs in an orderly manner to the ~~ user ~~
user who may intermittently feed said tubular formation into a machine adapted
to easily handle the prepositioned springs automatically in assembling a product
using one or more of the springs - The ~~ trick ~~ trick is to transfer the
spring as soon as it is formed from the forming machine to the paper or plastic
(sheet(s)or tubular formation and operate to secure them in an orderly and
predetermined position therein. Several packaging cross-sections would appear as
follows.

Fig.3 The border flange(s) may be used to drive the tubular package 1' or 1"
thru a feeding machine and may be used in coiling the package or in performing
other handling. The inner edge C of flange(s) D may be slit automatically to
remove each spring individually as the package is advanced or a slit C' may be
effected longitudinally in the wall 2 of the package or laterally as at C"
between those portions of the package containing the springs in a manner to
expose the end of the spring. Both packaging machine and a machine (apparatus)
for automatically removing the springs from the elongated tubular package are
conceived.

The apparatus 10 consists of a wire cooling machine 11 for forming short
openings S which are fed onto a rod 12 as they are cut off which rod 12 extends
outward from 11 between either

sheet or sheets 13a and 13b are shown fed from supply rolls 14 and 16 and
eventually and up in a tubular formation 13d which may be fed into a roll or
coil formation 22 on a drum or reel 22'. The individual coil springs SN, SN+1,

mechanism 18 which is power operated, mounted at the side of 12 and
automatically operated and synchronized to the operation of 11 and the drives
17c, 17c1 and 17d, 17d1 of sheets 13a and 13b. The tubular formation 13d ~~ as f
~~ with the springs resting in predetermined positions at spaced-apart intervals
therein is feed thru a stitching or heat sealing gluing or fastening machine 19
which either laterally and longitudinally seals the sheets together in a manner
to fix the positions of the springs (forms pockets or welds the sheets to
prevent longitudinal movement of the springs S so they may be automatically
removed from said tubular formation

at an assembly machine may be accomplished by apparatus such as illustrated in
Fig. 2 which apparatus, incidentally may be used for the removal of any tubular
product of limited length from a tubular package of the type provided on p. 19.
The tubed package 13d is continuously or intermittently fed from a feed drum or
box (not shown) by means of rolls 51, and 51' one of which is powered between a
pair of guide rolls 52 and the sheet material of 13d is slit by means of one or
more stationery or rotating blades 54 mounted adjacent the moving pacage. An
elongated rod 55 passes into the package in a position whereby the individual
coil springs S are carried thereon and pushed along 55 as the tubular package
13d" moves forward. The rod 55 is supported near one end as it rests against the
springs which rest against the lower portion of the slit package which rides
against the power rotated drum 53. The other end of 55 is supported by a
combination of movable mechanisms. A first support 56 has arms 57 and 57' which
slidably engage the bottom surface of 55 and

### Page 18
operates in a sliding movement to remove the end spring from the end of 55 and
carries it onto one arm (shown as 62) of an intermittently rotatable, indexing
fixture 60 shown containing 4 other arms 61, 63 and 64. An advancing pin 65

advance the springs ~~ and to ~~ onto mod 55 to keep them apart and prevent them
from bunching up. 56 must be lowered prior to its return so that the end of 57'
clears the next spring and this is effected by means of a a second cylinder 67
pivoting cylinder 59 which is interlocked in its operation to the operation of
59 and the rest of the apparatus The springs or articles on the arm, 63 or 64
may be removed by gravity or by a powered mechanism 66 and fed into the assembly
machine 70. Jerome H. Lemelson Nov 6, 1959 Nov. 7, 1959 The portion of the

formed by passing the laminate 10 thru the suitable rotating heated dies Which
permanently deform both the foam plastic layer and covering of PVF 14' fusing
the material of 14 as at 14a into a more dense framed or solid mass to retain
the irregular shape. The combination of 14 and 16 may be shaped per se or a
combination with 12. The shape ~~ d ~~ of the exterior surface of the panel 10
may also be effected by providing a sheet or layer 17 of flexible or rigid vinyl
or other plastic (such as polyethylene.) bonded to the surface 14' and ~~ hav~~
embossed or otherwise irregularly externally shaped on its outer surface 17' to
which is secured a coating on thin sheet 16' of ~~ PF ~~ polyvinylflouride ~~ 16
~~. The PVF, if a sheet may be bonded to 17 prior to the irregular external
shaping after which both flexible base 17 and 16 are embossed or shapped in a
heated die. If 16 is applied as a spray (dispersion of P.V.F. microparticles in
a bonder or solvent sprayed on- may be subject of patent application), then the
surface of 17 or 14 may have been preshaped or molded with the desired design
therein. On Fig. 3, the laminated panel 20 consists of a base sheet 22 of any
suitable material, having a flexible vinyl, polyeth or other sheet or layer 26
coating its exterior surface and a second sheet 27 of similar flexible plastic
heat sealed to 26 to form a plurality of enclosures or pockets ~~ 28a and ~~ two
of which 28a and 28b are shown the exterior volumes 29a, 29b, etc of which are

means or may be briefly interrupted permitting inflation and deflation of a
plurality of said pockets. The following ideas have been conceived by the
construction of toys having shell bodies with walls molded of flexible vinyl or
polyethylene and filled with foamed, flexible plastic, the cells of which are
interconnected to a degree such that air will be expelled thru an opening in the
walls when squeezed by hand which air will slowly flow back into the interior
framed filler when the walls are released and which action may be used to create
a noise if a whistle or reed noisemaker is provided in said opening. This idea
was conceived last March an I intend to complete sketches and a description and
disclose them to Dave Rosenberg of Holiday Line,

P.V.F. spray Nov. 17, 1959 The following idea was conceived by me some time ago
for possible development. It is conceived to form a dispersion of polyvinyl
fluoride plastic having a characteristic such that it may be aerosoled (sprayed)
cold / dispensed from a can by means of pressure generated by Freon or the like,
or by means of conventional spray equipment. It is also conceived to form a
dispersion of P.V.F. and P.V.C. combined in the proportions necessary to impart
the desired characteristics to the resulting film or coating derived when
sprayed on a surface. I mentioned the above to Marvin Margolis today who I asked
not to mention it to any of the representatives of Taussig Paint Company until I
am ~~ n ~~ able to obtain sample ~~ from ~~ of P.V.F. from du Pont and
experiment with in an attempt to form a dispersion which may be sprayed. I asked
Harold Wilson about dispersions today and he mentioned use of colloid mill,
fluid energy mill and supersonic homogenizer Also conceived some time ago were
several methods of applying Teflon coatings to metal surfaces, viz. (1) First
clean surface, (2) then apply an adhesive layer or coating such as Eastman 910
adhesive, Pliobond or other strong adhesive which will tenaciously adhere to the
surface to be coated with the plastic (Teflon, etc), (3) Then apply the
Teflon/dispersion, preferably air-drying as produced by Acheson Colloids, (urea
plastic base) which does not require heat. If Eastman 910 is to be used, since
pressure starts polymerization this may be effected by mechanically compressing
the surface of the article (if sheet by applying a Teflon surfaced roller
thereto under pressure) or by means of pressure applied as one or a series of
shock waves impinged against the surface of the article or the article may be
vibrated itself with sufficient force to start polymerization of the adhesive.

which 21 is shown which when energized by a source of alternating current causes
the rod 14 and tip 15 to vibrate by means of magnetostriction. The end of 15
when brought into contact with a surface thru the opening 17 of 16 and and
vibrated thereagainst will effect, an abrading acted on said surface. A fluid
inlet line 19 and outlet line 20 are connected to openings in the wall of 12 and
fluid may be circulated thereby thru the interior 13 of the jacket or duct 12.
The rod 14 is preferably rearward or inward of the plane of opening 17 so that
if it is desired to get the tool or tip 15 into a cavity this may be effected
without interference from 17. However, 17 may be of various external end shapes,
the selection of which will result from a consideration of the type and shape of
the surface against which the tool is to be abutted. By making the end 12 and/or
16 transparent, the operator may visually note the condition of the surface
against which it abuts. Other features of the invention include in addition to a
simple and rapid adjustment of the longitudinal position of 15, a rapid (push
button) means for varying or stopping and starting the flow of liquid thru the
chamber. The end 200 of 20 is shown positioned near the ~~tip ~~ end of tool 15
so that liquid will circulate properly and material removed by 15 will be
immediately withdrawn. Also conceived, and reference is made to my copending
application for Ultrasonic Apparatus is the use of a pressure switch in the
chamber 13 which may operate to automatically stop the flow of liquid thru the
chamber in the event there is an interruption in the seal established between
the face of 17 and the work. J. Lemelson Nov. 18, 1959 Witnessed, Read &

Dec. 9, 1959 The following packaging ideas have been conceived which I intend to
apply for patents on: A plastic known as Formium, manufactured by Form Molded
Products Company is available and may be subjected to temperatures of about 500
degrees before it starts to discolor. I have conceived of the following
packaging ideas using bowls, dishes or otherwise shaped containers of Formium or
any plastic which may be used in an oven for cooking.

Fig.1 ash tray, step bowl, covered lid double bowl decorative pan (colored) baby
set, lazy susan In Fig,.1 (shown in cross-section) the package 10 consists of a
bowl shaped container 11 made of thin sheet, temperature resistant plastic
having a circumscribing side wall 12, a flat bottom 16 and circumscribing rim

flexible sheet or film ~~18 ~~ 18 of suitable plastic such as polyethylene
covers the container 11 and is preferably heat sealed to the upper surface of
the rim 14 in a circumscribing sealing band 5. The notation of F refers to a
food mixture which is shown partially filling the

### Page 28
container. The mixture F may be a cake or other food pre-mix which is in a
concentrated state and rises during the baking thereof when the container is
placed in an oven. In the embodiment of Fig 1, the mix F is preferably frozen
and in a solid condition not only for its preservation but also to prevent it
from flowing throughout the container during handling and forming a coating on
the walls thereof which may dry up or crust. It is noted that the volume 17
which is void of contents is required since the food rises upon heating and will
overflow the container unless supported by the side-walls. The notation 19
refers to Illustration, and/or instructions printed. STOP START NEW-PAGE In the
embodiment of Fig. 2, a container 21 made of thin sheet material, has a
circumscribing wall on walls 22 with a step formation 23 provided therein which

him at 307 5th Ave, Chavell Products Company today. The company manufacture
novelty combs. While there I suggested the combination of a ball pen removably
attachable to a comb. viz.

Ball pen hollow to receive the end of a ball pen which becomes handle plastic

suggested that the walls of the tray illustrated on page 45 be extending upward
so that the ~~tray ~~ molding would become a basket with handles to enclose the
2 cans in or at least hold them together. The handles could extend over the top
and be fastened together as I suggest to Silverman. In other words a
lattice-like container for a plurality of products, shaped to extend around and
hold the products together could be molded and the product packed therein; to
serve as a premium in the event that the tray was not acceptable ~~The ~~by
Dutch Cleanser. I also suggested that the molding he made flat and the side
walls of such a basket he snapped together, preferably automatically as the two
cans are placed therein and suggested that this be applied to other canned,
boxed or bottled products to package them and as a premium. (g) While at Chavell

means to move in a predetermined path (focusing at or near the surface to be
coated) by means of conventional beam deflection means which may be regulated by
means of an analog signal reproduced from magnetic tape or other means in
predetermined time relation to reproduction of other control signals; The
electron beam may also be focused along a predetermined axis for a predetermined
time with said material flowing there thru after the work is automatically
controlled in its movement and position by the automatic controller; The
material to be coated may be a semi-conductor conductor or insulator in any
desired pattern ~~ dicated by ~~ determined by movement of the beam and/or the
position of a mask of any shape or other means between the beam and work. A mask
held stationery or movable, having a plurality of openings any one of which the
beam may be directed thru by control of its deflection, is also conceived. The
beam may also be generated per se prior to introduction of the coating material
to condition (heat or erode) the surface of the work to be coated and/or
generated after wating to work to effect the material deposited on the work. By
first introducing one material into the beam and then a second without moving
the beam or work, alternate layers of material may be built up. By automatic
control of the focal point and/or the degree of divergences as well as power
input to the beam, the area to be coated (width of a line of coating for example
as beam is moved) may be controlled to effect the formation of such surface
patterns as line conductors, resistors, etc: A servo or servos may also be
provided and automatically controlled to select and/or position different areas
of a mask or different masks in alignment with a stationery or movable beam.

January 26, 1960 Applications and improvements in TPR (GE. thermoplastic
recording) It is conceived to adapt the recently released T.P.R system to single
frame recording for so called "animated cartooning" or the like. The system as
announced by G.E. involves only the production of motion pictures and since the
section of the thermoplastic tape heated by induction (in the G.E. apparatus) is
well in advance of the section or length of the tape, it is not possible to
shoot individual frames with a time delay between each which is ~~ faster ~~
longer than the time it takes for the frame to pass thru modification to the
apparatus. Accordingly, a number of modifications to apparatus of this type are
hereby proposed to effect "cartooning" or single frame function. (1.) In the
first apparatus, automatic control means are provided for automatically drawing
the single exposed frame~~ pa ~~ of tape pat the induction heating means to form
the so called "ripple" image in the thermoplastic and when so formed (after
the~~ same ~~single frame section has passed the heating device, the induction
heater is automatically turned off, followed by the automatic reversal of the
tape which is automatically driven rearward 1/28/60 1/31/60 LW EW 2/1/60 M

Time of heat (induction) "on" to determine usage until the length of the tape
following that length in which the image was last formed is in a position in
advance of the electron gun scanning field such that the next time the ~~ sca ~~
electron gun is energized (actually the next time the manually operated
switching control to effect the recording of a single frame, is energized). See
drawing hereafter. (2)In a second conceived apparatus, the tape is moved
intermittently, one frame at a time thru the field of the electron gun the beam
of which is modulated by the picture signal derived from scanning ~~ an ~~ image
field. The ~~ frame ~~ tape stops with the leading edge of the next frame length
in a position to be just scanned by the electron beam which is turned off at the
end of the frame sweep. While awaiting the (manual)switching action which will
initiate the next recording cycle in which the next frame length of tape will
receive an image charge pattern, one of the following actions may occur: (a)The
frame just scanned may have the corresponding (image) ripple pattern formed
therein (or any frame downstream thereof) by the automatic emerging of the
induction heating means. This may be effected by either a stationery induction
heater head or one which is automatically moved close to the tape adjacent the
scanning field immediately after or during scanning, energized or a
predetermined time, then deenergized an retracted. The frame following the frame
just scanned and heated may also be heated. To reduce this effect, an insulating
shutter or sheet member may be automatically moved over and made to engage
either or both surfaces of the thermoplastic tape to reduce or eliminates the
heating effect. The shutter gate may be a shielding material which will ~~ it ~~
reflect or absorb the induction energy. (b) The charge pattern may be retained
in the tape by means of a charge intensifier ~~put on~~

to retain it therein until it passes the induction head downstream of the
scanning field. When ~~ the ~~ each frame

### Page 61
enters the induction field, the induction heating means is energized "on" for
the period of time necessary to form the image therein. During the induction
heating cycle the length of tape behind (upstream of) the frame being heated is
either cooled by electronic, conduction ~~ or( ~~ contact with a cooled (liquid)
surface or convective means and/or is shielded by a member which absorbs or
reflects the ~~ induced ~~ radio wave energy. (c) Two or more tracks on tape are
employed with an automatic (flipflop) gating means for switching the output of
the means generating the picture signal to respective of the two electron guns.
This will permit sufficient time for the image on one tape to be formed, the
ripple pattern developed by heat and the tape recycled (or stopped per se) while
the surface of the other tape or channel is so operated on to form the next
image. The images from each may then be alternately scanned automatically and
reinserted or reformed, onto a single tape, or may be alternately projected by
means of an oscellating ~~ or rotating ~~ single mirror or prism or rotating
multi-faceted mirror, thru a single optical system onto a common screen or image
forming or scanning system. SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM OF THE APPARATUS #1 PAGE. 65.

FIG. 2 In the drawing (at the left,) all stationery components are assembled to
be supported by the walls of the housing 101 or bracket extending thereafter.
The apparatus 100 consists of a sealed enclosure 101 having a gear motor 102
mounted therein for driving a disc 104 which is a multilayer TPR. recording
material produced in accordance with the G. E. TPR tape with the exception that
the high melting base film is rigid enough to maintain the disc in a rigid
planer shape when rotated at recording speed by 102. An electron-gun 106
provides a raster scan or the like on an annular surface of 104 which provides
an annular charge pattern thereon. A first R.F. heater is positioned "down
stream" of 106 which melts the thermoplastic layer of 104 wherein the electro
static charges on the film and the ground plane depress the surface of the
melted layer creating the so called ripple pattern therein. The rippled surface
then ~~ is rotated ~~ passes thru an optical septum 110, 110' which may be used
for the projection of the image onto a screen or to an electronic scanning
device such as a cathode ray reading tube or the like. A second RF heater 112

pattern before it passes thru the exposure scanning field of 106. Several
variations in the apparatus of Fig. 2 are noted. (a) ~~ If ~~ The apparatus 100,

received, for example, by the gun 106 in the form of modulated intensity and/or
deflection signals in a random manner such as from a library of said
information, the results of a computing mechanism or the output of a scanner
such as a video camera or radar device It may be desired to randomly record this
information as it is received and erase it only after it has been identified or
otherwise utilized. To prevent information to be recorded onto an area of 104
(or tape 26 of fig. 1) Which already has a recording thereon, the input to 106
may be from an image storage tube (or apparatus similar to Fig 2) which retains
the information until an area approaches the scanning zone adjacent 106 which is
free of an image ripple pattern. The notations 114 and 115 therefor relate to an
optical-relay positioned ahead of the scanning area of 106 which optically scans
thru the disc (or tape) across said annular recording area and provides a signal
output only when the light generated by a light source in 114 is diffracted by a
ripple or image deformation pattern. The signal (or lack of signal) may be used
to present the operation of the read beam of the intermediate storage tube
feeding 106, which read beam is triggered to cycle only upon the lack (or

area of 104 being scanned by ~~ 114 ~~ relay 114, 115 may be free of an image
(such as a white background of an image field), it is conceived to automatically
control the electron gun 106 to either provide a deformation in the form of an
annular ripple band near the outer rim of 104 (or the border of tape 26) when an
image charge pattern is being provided on a portion of the disc which ~~ def ~~
band deformation will deflect the light of relay 114, 115 the necessary degree
to either energize or deenergize said relay to cause a sequal output therefrom.
The scanner-relay 114, 115 may consist of a photocell and light source arranged
as follows:

preferably secured to a second housing 115a positioned the other side of disc
104 (or tape 26) by means of a rigid bar 114'. A lens 114d positioned in the

These design for a plastic sheet will ~~ form ~~ provide a material which is
flexible and may be used in packaging, yet which has reenforcing bands formed of
more rigid (irradiated) portions of the same material for added strength. Note
A- The plastic sheet may be irradiated as it is extruded, a calandered or while
otherwise in a molted state, by beams of radiant energy directed against the
moving sheet Note B- Irradiation may be effected by using a shield or mask to
prevent irradiation of areas not to be so changed Note C- Irradiation may be
used to change color, clarity or to provide unique designs in band or other
areas of sheet. The mask itself may provide ~~ the ~~ unusual contours in the
plastic sheet if it (a) moves with the sheet (radiator stationery), (b) sheet
and mask are stationery while radiation source irradiates (then turns off or is
shuttered off) Note D: If a mask such as lead is used which varies in thickness
across the mask, then if a constant intensity source of radiation is used the
areas of the sheet or article being irradiated which are in line with the
thinner portions of the mask will receive greater doses of radiation than those
areas in line with heavier portions of the mask. If color changes in the
material are experienced in proportion to the radiation, then shade may be
controlled by mask thickness (as well as radiation intensity and time of
exposure) and different shades of color or clarity may be effected in a design
in the irradiated material by using a mask having certain areas thicker than
others. A mask of tapering thickness will produce a gradual variation in color

July 14, 1960 It has been conceived by me to combine a means or plurality of
means for focusing sunlight with a semi-conductor means or other means for
converting heat into electricity to provide an efficient heat-to-electricity
energy converter. Reference is made to a plastic parabolic or spherical
reflector developed by me several months ago and recorded in another notebook
which may be used in one or more of the following configurations: Fig. 1

Fig. 1 illustrates the basic components of the invention which comprise an
assembly 10 consisting of a base 11 of sheet material having a cavity 12 of
parabolic or spherical shape and adapted for focusing sun-light in a
concentrated area near the focal plane of the focusing mirror defined

spherical reflection 12'. The area of 16 is preferably such that it will operate
efficiently even if the position of the ~~ fo ~~ center of the intense light
focused by 12' shifts ~~ whi~~ with changing attitudes relative to the direction
of the such. ~~ It is ~~ The converter 16 ~~ of~~ is furthermore large enough to

Beam Deposition Continued/Nov 2-61 Fig. 3

All deposits are by beam controlled by analog signals reproduced from a recorder
which recorders programmed signals (reproductions) also control material
selection (introduced) into beam rate of flow thereof, travel of beam across
work modulation and on-off of beam, position of workpiece, handling of work
within and in and out of vacuum chambers, etc. Feedback signals for indicating
how much material is deposited and where to control beam position, rate of flow
and selection of different materials to be admitted to beam may be effected by
means of a reading electron beam directed by computer on programmed (recorded
signals) to scan selected area or scanning entire target as the material is
deposited or during periods when material is THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ &

derived by beam scanning may be analyzed by techniques as described in my
pending application "Automatic Inspection System" to ~~digitally ~~ determining
in digital form the characteristic (optical characteristic) of the material
deposited. Spectroscopy may also be employed in which a beam is directed against
the beam deposited area and causes an emission of electrons therefrom which is
spectrally analyzed, the results of which are used to control further deposition
or removal of deposited material. EL 11/20/61 Material from p.138 to this point

positionally controlled by command signals derived from command recording as
described or comparator receiving command and feedback signal as described. II

position of focus (Z control depending on position of the surface scandeposited
on) for (a) depositing semi-conductors metal or dielectric materials (b)
depositing plural materials simultaneously different beams (c) depositing plural
materials at different times by different beams (d) introducing different

control or refrence signals, plus work positioning, signals (optional), plus
focus adjustment signals (optional) plus other mentioned above are used to
simultaneously or sequentially control beams each depositing different material
or materials VI Beam Deposition Techniques (Miscellaneous features) (a) Electron
beam plus photographic techniques. (1) Beam deposits components onto conducting
film pattern formed by photo-etching, photocomposition (exposure to light and
developing) (2) Optical beam (laser light beam) is deflection controlled and
cooperates with deflection controlled electron beam in welding, machining,
effecting deposition, chemically reacting on ~~ dep ~~ material(s) deposited by
electron beam, etc laser light bean may also be used to carve photosensitive
film, expose it per se, develope image, used for corrective purposes (vaporize
or machine material (film) deposited by electron beam, vaporize material(s) to
be deposited or directed by electron beam, ~~ etc ~~ work, etc. Laser beam
deflection controlled by servo controlled mirror(s) controlled by reproduced
command signal or output of comparator or computer (b) Plural beams cooperate.
One vaporizes (laser or electron beam) material to be deposited; feeds it at or
to second deposition beam, ~~ there ~~ which is deflection controlled and
deposites material, third beam scans either second beam or surface which has
just received material to provide a feedback signal for a comparator (summary
amplifier or other) which provides an output to control both first and second
beams (i.e. on-off or intensity or focus of first beam and position of second

well by passing beam thru the mask respective comparator means each of which
receives some feedback signal generated by third beam scanning what is being or
was just deposited. (c) An apparatus for repairing, modifying or adding micro
miniature circuits has also been conceived based on beam scanning the circuit
already deposited (surface scanning) and determining by reading with the beam
the physical-optical or atomic structure of the circuit, by x-ray scanning, by
optical scanning said circuit (with a modulated light beam) or by a combination
of two or three of these scanning techniques, has been conceived. The output
signal derived by scanning is ~~ defined ~~ fed to a computer which thereafter
provides signals for controlling beam deflection, modulation, position of
workpiece, material deposition selection and feed to beam, mask selection, etc.
to effect a desired repair, change in structure, etc (d) Vaporization of
material in a primary electron beam(s) or by means of a mask through which
beam(s) the deposition beam is passed and picks up the material to be deposited,
carries it to work. (e) Material changed by new composition(s) formed in a beam
directed against a workpiece by either the action of the beams per se or the
coaction of the beam (temperature, etc)and two or more of the materials thereto
on one or more admitted material and any material of the workpiece. (f) Growth
of predetermined crystal structure by means of beam melting material(s) admitted
thereto and deposited, or by a combination of materials admitted to beam being
deposited thereby onto a crystal being grown. Programmed control of beams
deflection, on-off, modulation, focus; crystal movement; material flow into beam
(based on feedback derived by scanning beam, crystal, etc. (as described above)
fed into comparator also receiving command signal and providing difference
signal for control. (g) Creation of mask through which erosion electron beam is
directed for chemically &/or mechanically affecting (eroding, changing
chemically, welding, etc) the workpiece by means of photosensitive mask
material, thermoplastic recording film (T.P.R.) of General Electric Co which
mask is formed by exposure to a writing beam of said mask material which writing
beam is modulated to affect the desired image (transparent and opaque or ripple)
pattern in the mask. Mask ~~ may ~~ is in the field of the beam EL 12/4/61

directed against the workpiece (in the path of beam). (h) Use of a unique mask
in beam path made of a grating such as a diffraction grating produced by beam
etching thin plate for selective and controlled deposition of material
introduced  prior to or after passing thru mask. Plural diffraction gratings
placed at right angles to each other will produce line beams less than .001
inches in diameter. (i) Use of a mask to break up beam internal electron or
maser beam into a plurality of beams directed thereafter against selected areas
of the workpiece for ~~sele~~ effecting welding, machining (hole drilling),
erosion or deposition onto said select areas. (j) Program control (plus feedback
where necessary) of beam position (deflection), , etc position of workpiece, and
of different material fed into beam to selectively deposite different material
onto different areas of workpiece. (k) Exposure, machining, chemically changing,
development and firing of a photosensitive material to form a circuit by means
of a beam and use of a beam to deposit semi-conducting, dielectric & conducting
material onto selected areas of photosensitively developed circuits all by

Development work is continuing on the toothbrush and air conditioner, a more
rapid pace being prevented by the ~~ au ~~ inventor's research and school
activities. The following invention was conceived yesterday: A Chemically Heated
Shoe: The inventor conceives of a shoe for the human foot so manufactured that
the soles and (or) heels are made with hollow cavities or means thereof to carry
a liquid or ~~ chemical ~~ solid chemical which will produce the correct amount
of heat when reacting with another chemical for the purpose of warming the feet.
The following are some possible design considerations for this invention: 1 The
use of tubing or metal containers

### Page 8
October 26-49 for carrying the chemical while it reacts. (2) A one way valve for
filling the tubing or caveties with the chemicals. A valve for releasing the
reacted chemicals to all a new charge to flow in: (3) Use of a pressurized
container to hold the chemicals and release them when applied to the valve. This
would simplify carrying and filling of the caveties. The following sketch is a
preliminary design consideration.

The above may also be used as a pad which strap to the ordinary shoe or, the

light' and will look further into this patent in the development of this
invention. As stated, the glass tube winds around the interior of the shell.
Small holes, backed by colored celluloid (or uncovered) are drilled in the shell
opposite the glass tube. The liquid in the tube is opaque so that the bubble,
traveling past the hole has the effect of an opening shutter. Thus as each
bubble passes a hole, a 'blinking on' on the light from the inside of the shell
occurs. Preliminary Sketch of invention:

Nov 6, 1949 the usual placement ~~ of a cigarette ~~ is difficult such as in a
moving automobile where the vibration may jar it loose if just placed in the
ordinary holder. The clamping of the cigarette is accomplished by a light
magnetic force, not enough to squeeze the cigarette so that it is damaged. The
device is so made that the jaws which hold the cigarette do not completely close
when the cigarette is in place. A light magnetic force thus holds the cigarette
in position and removal is relatively easy. Exact design details will be worked
out. Magnetic gears on Magnetic Coupling: A coupling device consisting of two
wheels with teeth of magnetic material is conceived. The teeth do not mesh. One

idea for a Toy: The toy consists of two figures free to swivel about their bases
each of which is magnetic. Thus, rotation of one automatically rotates the other
by the repelling action of the magnets in the base. (i.e- all south poles point
out in one figure whereas all north poles point out in the other) Sketch of Toy:

Obstacle Course. or Pilot.

Nov. 20-49 21 Description of Game: Game consists of playing board of
non-magnetic material which is flat and smooth ~~ f ~~ enough for a small flat
bottomed object to roll or slide over. To this board are attached a number of
magnets, each of which represents an obstacle to the scoring puck or pellet. A
permanent magnet attached to a string, stick or other object or held in the hand
is used as the motivating medium for the puck. This is accomplished by moving it
over the puck which is also a magnet or of magnetic material and allowing the
force of the magnet to slide or roll the puck without lifting it to it. On
scoring, obstacles (magnets) nearest the starting point are scored lowest; when
and if the ultimate goal is reached without attraction to any of the obstacle
magnets, it is scored highest. Attraction to the motivating magnet automatically
eliminates the piece. Diagram of game board:

Nov. 21, 1949 Magnetic Game (continued) a variation of the game described on
page 21 would involve the use of a score board without obstacles but with just a
scored path painted on its surface over which the puck must be moved. Segaments
of the path are scored with increasingly higher numbers as the objective or
finishing point are approached. In testing out the magnetic game idea the
inventor noticed that it takes a considerable amount of skill to move the puck
without attracting it to the motivating magnet. The correct distance between the
pucks & motivator must be kept so that it is just lifted off the surface and may
be moved in the desired direction. Variations in game design: 1. The puck may be
shaped like an airplane which must overcome the obstacles along the course. 2.
Magnetic Football Game: The puck may be the ball carrier and the opposite side
composed of movable magnetics which are positioned before hand by the opposite
player. The controller of the puck must move it through the opposition. Jerome

Nov. 22, 1949 Conception of Invention: Magnetic Educational Toy: This toy
utilized sheet magnetic plastics. It consists of various flat shapes of magnetic
plastic sheet (squares, circular discs, half discs, dots, strips, etc) which
make up a kit. This come in various colors and are used to build figures by
letting them adhere to a metallic board to form the various design (over)

Nov.23,1949 An investigation has been made to "determine the availability of"
magnetic plastics for the above toy. It appears as if very little development
work has been done on magnetic plastics to date with the only available shapes
on the

market today being cylinders which are used for electronic work. Until such is
developed in sheet form for this toy, the inventor suggests the following
construction for the toy described on pp. 23,24 Backboard The assembly board on
which the shapes are mounted is made of sheet steel or iron or other magnetic
material (not a magnet) Assembly pieces: Piece #1, the head of the figure, is
made of a piece of sheet metal which is magnetic attractive. Set in the piece or
glued to it are small flat magnets for attraction to the backboard. The other
pieces 2,3,4,5,6,7,8, etc. are made of colored sheet plastic with small flat
magnets set in them for attachment to the backboard or glued to them. Typical

Nov. 26,1949 heated shoe), the inventor some time ago conceived of the following
method of shoe heating. The device ~~ of ~~ consists of a specially constructed
shoe which is insulated beneath the second sole, the second sole and heel made
with hollow cavities into which may be placed a cartridge or several cartridges
which, in turn, contain the reacting chemicals previously described. The
chemicals are separated from each other and may be caused to mix by bending the
cartridge or by some other mechanical manipulation such as the pressure of the
foot squeezing it. The inventor further recommends the uses of two chemicals
such as those used in the Thermite welding process, (iron oxide and aluminum)
which, as it is understood at this reading, is used in portable soldering irons
today to generate heat. Information on the  so called 'heat capsules' has been
requested from the manufacturer, a firm in Maryland. The inventor wishes to
bring out the following points on this invention. (1) The use of a highly
conductive witnessed by H. Lemelson Nov. 27, 1949 Nov. 26, 1949 material which
surrounds the capsule (heating capsule) cavity or heating tubes if a liquid
mixture of exothermic chemicals is added thru the valves (see p. 10) and which
extends to the far sections of the sole in contact with the foot of the wearer
for the conduction of heat to all the parts of the sole. (2) Design of the
Capsule: Due to the tremendous heat liberated when the Thermite process occurs,
it may be necessary to place the chemicals between two sheets of metal which are
placed close together; thus limiting the time of reaction. It is obvious to the
inventor that a method is needed for the regulation of the process such as a
valving system which allows only a small amount of the chemicals to react at a
time. (3)If exothermic liquids are used they may be introduced into a flat steel
walled cavity or tank which is embedded in the sole rather than the tubing
described. This would allow an easy replacement of the container if it is made
to slip out from the cavity in which it fits. Filling would be simplest thru one
way valves from a pressurized container. Jerome Lemelson Nov. 26-1949 Witnessed

controlling mechanism below the board consists of adjustable linkages,

slides and rotating arms so that magnets traveling below the surface can be
adjusted to travel a number of different shaped paths. The mechanism is motor
driven and easily accessible so that variations in the linkages may be made by
the operator when desired. Simple kimematies is thus taught to the youngster who
is mechanically minded. Adjustments in linkage arms, etc. may be easily made by
tightening and loosening small wing nuts or screws with a screw driver. The

1949 (8:30 PM) Conceptions of Inventions: The following inventions have been
conceived today. I: Doll; animated: The doll is made of rubber or plastic with a
relatively flexible neck (adams apple) and ~~ cheeel ~~ cheeks, the reson being
so that these arts may be made to move mechanically. For example, the adams
apple may be made to move up and

### Page 25
down as does a humans in swallowing by placing a round weight or ball in the
dolls mouth and having the doll swallow if thus activating a mechanism in the
neck which causes the adams apple to move ; or merely by placing the object on
the toung  of the doll or puppet. The same mechanism may also cause the lips to
curl up as in a smile or the eyes to open wide by linkages. Relatively flexible
rubber would be needed to imitate the facial and neck skin of the down. The
weight or ball would be recovered from the back of the doll. The same principle
could be applied to a small hard banks doll which smiles when a coin is
deposited in its mouth or thru  a slot in its head. Witnessed by: H. Lemelov

removable under which a loose wig (of grass etc) may be placed, there being hair
on the repacible. Thus a wig may be positioned by the child and trimmed with a
scissor. The child thus imitates a barber. (2) The same effect may be
accomplished by the use of a ceramic doll with a hollow head in which dirt is
placed and grass or chard is grown. The doll could be a window sill ornament for
the child to trim:every now and then. Witnessed by H. Lemelov 11/29/49 III
Hatching Chick Toy: This toy consists of an imitation egg shell (of plastic or
some other similar material) inside of which is a tiny chick. The egg is
assembled from two parts which realistically crack apart when a toy hen is
placed on it. This is accomplished as follows. The egg made ~~ to ~~ of two
separate partitions snaps together by a latch on the inside of the egg. A hole
through the shell to the latch is a recepticle ~~ to the latch ~~ for a peg in
the bottom of the hen. Thus when the peg is put in the hole and the peg is faced
down, the egg splits in two. The ~~latch ~~ egg may be spring loaded so that
once it is forced by the peg, there is a force alerted to open the shell.

shooting or throwing game in which objects are propelled toward the target. 1
The target ~~ bord ~~ board consists of objects such as little figures,
vehicles, airplanes, bottles etc. which serve as targets for the shooter to aim
at. These objects have little permanent magnets attached to them. The target
board itself has top, bottom and sides of steel sheet or other magnetically
affected material which serve as a base on which the figures are placed. A small
model plane, for example can be attached magnetically to a rod, or plug
extending from the ceiling and fired at. Small toy soldiers with magnets in
their bases can be attached to a mound in the target area and knocked off by the
sharpshooter. A small ball shaped object can be suspended magnetically and
knocked down. etc. Witnessed by: H. Lemelson 11/29/49 IV Magnetic Horseshoe Game

Nov. 28, 49 at the center of a verticle target and permanent magnetic horshoes
are pitched at the target, the object being to ring the peg. Rules are similar
to regular horseshoes. The magnets should be small and strong so that they do
not come off the board and the board should be tipped a bit away from the
throwerWitnessed by H. Lemelson 11/29/49 VI Magnetic Lapel Holder: This device

cavities in the shoe each containing a reactive chemical. The chambers both have
a means for loading ~~ and ~~ new chemicals and removing the reacted chemicals.
The Chambers may be separated by a partition or valve to keep the chemicals out
of contact with each other after they have been loaded. A simple mechanism such

Witnessed by H. Lemelson 11/29/49 Nov.29, 1949 Conception of Several New Toy
Inventions: (I.) Magnetic Trapese Artists Toy: This invention utilizes the
phenomena of magnetic attraction and the fact that a magnet may be uncoupled
from a piece of iron or another magnet by a light force depending on the
strength of the magnet. The toy consists of a miniature replica of the circus
trapese artists. A small light toy figure of the performer is suspended from one
of the trapeses bars by a magnet in its base. The figure is cast outstretched ~~
and ~~ and ~~ if ~~ reaching out with its arms or, it may have movable legs and
arms for variation by the player. The hands of the figure are hook shaped so
that they may hook over the other bar or a bar suspended from another figure. (A
multitude of variations are possible. NOTE: An electromagnet on each bar, which
may be turned on and off, may be used rather than permanent magnets.) The toy
game or toy may be played in

Nov.29, 1949 several ways. Both the figure and the receiving trapese may be set
in motion by release from a high point on the usual ~~ as ~~ starting point of
circus performers by the use of a release latch or they may simply be put in
motion by the hand. Pressing a button may shut off the electromagnet ~~ at ~~ on
the bar of the toy performer and release him to the other bar or his hooking to
the other bar may separate his permanent magnetic base from the original bar.
Two performers may also be used using magnets of different strength so that one
may be uncoupled while the other holds fast. The hooking action may be attained
by an outstretched bar attached to the hands of one performer. Again, the
release of one figure may be accomplished by an electromagnet shutting off on
the bar to which he is attracted or by hooking to the other bar. Sketch:

Note: In respect to the trapese toy, coupling of the two figure may be
accomplished magnetically- utilizing either stronger magnets in the hands of the
artists for coupling than the base magnet of one or an electro-magnet release
from one and attraction from the others outstretched arms. Witnessed by H.
Lemelson 11/29/49 II. Propelled Toy Ducks: or Whate (WHALE). This invention
consists of a toy duck OR WHALE of light ~~ colored ~~ material such as plastic;
wood, rubber etc a light metal which floats stabely and is propelled thru the
water in one of the following manners. I. Mechanical Propulsion: This may be
attained thru a paddle coupled to a winding spring or a paddle wheel also spring
wound, on by a propeller coupled to a winding spring. II. Jet Propulsion: This
may be accomplished in one of several ways. (a) By steam pressure utilizing a
standard put-put system in which a small candle or tablet is burned under a
small tank of water. A pressure is thus built up against the back pressure of
the water, the steam being emitted at rapid intervals causing a net forward
thrust - (known to the art) (b) By the inflation of a plastic bag

Nov. 29, 1949 or baloon within the toy figure and the resulting escape of the
gases rearward A simple baloon may be used which inflates within the figure to
its approximate shape or the following system may be employed The inside baloon
~~ figure ~~ may be blown up at some point on figure's surface such as the bill
of the duck, the spout point of the whale, etc. A one way valve consisting of a
tiny ball and seat at the filling joint may be utilized to prevent escape from
this point. During filling, the escape nozzle may be shut off by a twisting
action or by a plug. This too may have a one way (escape) action to prevent
water from filling the figures bladder: A small spring loaded ball would suffice
for this purpose. The same principle may be applies to the other shapes of the
toys. Jerome Lemelson Witnessed by: H Lemelson 11/29/49 (Refer to pp. 11-13) The
inventor conceives that it may be necessary to use a heating element to generate
large enough bubbles for the blinking ornament to function properly.

Nov. 30, 1949 Conception of Inventions: I. Toy Cow Which Can Be Milked: This toy
consists of the figure of a cow which is molded, stamped, or otherwise formed of
a light material and which has the following mechanism so that the cow may be
milked. The cow’s head may be manufactured so that it is bending over, or may be
made to bend over a pan containing milk, water, or other liquid which resembles
milk. A tube in the cow’s mouth submerges in the liquid with the mouth. The cow
drinks up the liquid when to operator pumps the tail or pulls it, thus either
operating a pump in the body of the cow or drawing in on a piston and filling in
the manner that a syringe is filled. The piston is spring loaded so that the
liquid is under pressure. A one way valve at the mouth prevents the liquid from
flowing out the mouth. A valve at the cow’s ~~ brest ~~ breast is made so that
it will allow passage of the fluid only when the breast is pulled as in milking
the real cow. The cow can be made to “moo” when it’s milked for realism. A
preliminary sketch will be drawn when the inventor finds time in a few days.

Record of Conception of New Inventions The following inventions were conceived
on this date all involving the spring

### Page 35
Dec. 1-49 loaded piston described in the inventions on the preceding two pages.
The spring loaded piston is used as a source of energy to supply a stream of
water for an optical effect or may be used to propell a device (toy) thru the
water. The following sketch will describe it for a preliminary design
considerations. (large intake valve opening for easy loading) 1) is a pull rod
for loading or cocking the piston. It is pulled back by the operator in loading:
(2) is a spring which is compressed when the piston is cocked. (3) is the
cylinder or shell in which the piston slides,(4), the piston, (5) the reservoir
for the liquid, (6) may be a one way intake valve and (7) a one way exhaust
valve which may be shut on or off for loading by a screw, needle valve, etc. The
device is being developed by the inventor. Jet Propelled Boat: This toy consists
of a toy boat made of a light or hollow material inside of which is placed the
above spring loaded piston. The piston is cocked directly by hand

Dec. 1,1949 possibly by the use of a lever to gain a mechanical advantage. To
minimize leaks, it should be made of a relatively flexible or soft material
which expands when wet against the walls of the cylinder. It should be backed
with a stiff material - Rubber may serve the purpose of the flexible material

string may be attached to the piston rod here and pulled) Cocking the piston
loads the reservoir. When released, the spring forces the piston rearward and
since water is an incompressible liquid, the pressure of the spring forces it
out of the exhaust orifice at a high velocity which jet propells the boat. III
Fire Boat: Note: an additional tap off hose or line may be run from the cylinder
to supply water for a fire hose treated on the deck of the boat. IV Paint
Sprayer: The spring loaded piston and cylinder may also be utilized for spraying
small quantities at a time of thin paint. This could be utilized for a cheap
sprayer for such items a touch up

mounted on moving toy figure which is composed of parts which ~~are~~
magnetically hold each other together. The object of the game is to knock the
figure apart with pellets from a spring loaded gun. For example, the figure may
be that of a snowman of white plastic. The pellets may be shaped & colored like
snowballs. The idea or purpose would be to attempt of break-up the snowman by
first hitting this to magnetically held on hat, then his head then his limbs,
etc. To be expanded. VI. Toy Automobile which can be stopped at red light. This
toy consists of a small wind up or battery powered automobile which turns around
on a smooth ~~back~~ forward on a table. A traffic light at one point of the
roadbed or track can be operated on or off, red or green. When the red is
operated, an electric magnet beneath the roadbed is turned on, and this in turn
causes Dec. 1, 1949 the toy to stop by either attracting a light spring loaded
switch in the car cutting off its powder (under the body of the car) or just
holding the car to the board. The car would have to have its body's bottom
nearly sliding on the surface for this latter technique to succeed. The author
has just conceived of further applications of this principle. The
electro-magnets placed at various points under the roadbed may be made to cause
the toy to go thru various gyrations, and to control its motion by holding
itself and necessarily the car perhaps say 90 degrees to its original direction
~~with~~ by using another electro magnet for rotation. A small alnico permanent
magnet in the car may help the action. Further investigation and development is
necessary. Jerome Lemelson Dec. 1, 1949 Witnessed by H. Lemelson Dec. 5, 1949
December 2, 1949 It is conceived that the precociously described piston (p.50)
may prove quite costly to manufacture for a toy. The following alternatives are
conceived if the cost is too high. If a piston is used

### Page 37
it would probably be ~~ most ~~ preferable to make it of leather or rubber with
a stiff metalic or other backing such as the piston in the master cylinder of an
automobile's hydraulic brake. Alternatives to the piston described. (1) Use of a
spring loaded bellows similar to that used in a pressure measuring instrument.
This would again involve a cylinder in which the bellows is placed, a large one
way intake valve for loading and a smaller controllable exhaust valve for the
various applications (2) Use of a flexible bag which may be filled with the
liquid merely pouring in there a neck in the container  sure Before loading, a
piston loaded by a spring is cocked so that it may react later on the bag (i.e.
baloon , plastic bag, etc) Sketch:

The bag (3) is filled thru (1), a fitting with a screw on cap. (4) is a piston
riding in container (2). It is spring loaded by spring (5) when cocked. (6) is
the plunger for cocking the piston. The device may be supplied with a stop
mechanism

(7) which holds the plunger in an 'out' position in loading. Reference is made
to the mechanism in the fountain tooth brush on page 8. The inventor has
conceived of using this mechanism to feed shoe polish in a pasty form or in a
liquid for thru the handle of a shoe brush where it is stored for the purpose of
supplying the polish merely by pushing the button in the handle which decorates
the mechanism. A sketch will clarify:

designed by the inventor and the drawings are being reproduced. Conception of a
Toy: (Dentist's Kit) This toy (described in brief) is a make-believe dentist kit
which consists of a dummy or doll with a large mouth which

### Page 38
Dec 2, 1949 can be opened and a removable set of teeth which can be worked on by
the child playing with the kit. A foot powered drill is supplied together with
teeth which may be drilled. The teeth are made of a soft material which ~~ ia ~~
is easily drilled. A silvered putty or clay is used for fillings and brass sheet
is supplied for gold cap mutation. The dummy may also be set in a swivel chair
for realism. Other dental accessories may also be supplied such as a toy x-ray
set with a light or camera in it, etc. II Doctor Set (Surgical) This involves
supplying a plastic doll or dummy in ~~ with the  in kit form together with
simple instruments for performing an operation. The doll may be so made that it
comes apart for operating purposes and panels open up over its chest, intestine,
etc. The internal parts may then be made of a soft plastic putty like material
which is easily cut, stitched, etc. Witnessed by H. Lemelson Dec. 3, 1949 Dec.
5, 1949 Doll With a Heart Beat This invention involves the placing of a single
spring wound mechanism with an endurance of several minutes or more inside

the doll or puppet. The noise of the heart beat may be attained in one of
several ~~ a number of ways namely: (1) By having a light arm, attached to the
mechanism, strike a hollow drum or sounding board at a pace similar to normal
heartbeat. (2) By the use of a watch or clock mechanism of correct dimensions
and material to produce a beat which is somewhat like a heartbeat. (3) By the
use of a small electric motor coupled to the correct mechanism for the
production of a beat. (4) By the use of an electro-vibrator of a slow frequency
(80 to 100 per second) which flexes a membrane or drum. Others will be recorded
as conceived. Manicuring Doll: This invention refers to a toy figure or doll
which can be manicured by the playing child. This is accomplished by the use of
plastic finger nails which are removable and replaceable merely by snapping them
into the finger roots. They are held in place by compression of the plastic
finger nail as it is bent for inserted into The toy is unique in that the nails

This invention involves a doll with a movable jaw which has teeth which may be
removed, either as a false tooth bridge or singly. Two other dolls which will be
described tomorrow are (1) a whistling doll (2) a doll which plays the
harmonica. Dec. 4, 1949 Doll with Toy Whistle: This doll consists of a
conventional toy doll which is equipped with facilities for blowing a toy
whistle. Sketch.

Doll head. Tapered hole (1) (2) tubing to (3)

Tube to fit in hole in doll's mouth WHISTEL

Dec. 4, 1949 A conventional doll's head is so made that a small hole (1) is
formed in the middle of its lips which connects to tubing (3). The hole may be
so tapered that insertion of the tube to the end of a conventional or especially
made whistle for the doll may fit in and be held securely by a little pressure.
A tapered hole for example would suffice. The tubing (3) may either extend out
the back of the doll so that the whistle may be blown by a human; may extend to
a bellows in the doll so that squeezing will blow the whistle or may extend to a
bellows outside the doll which may be squeezed. Drinking Doll: This refers to a
doll which drinks water or other liquid thru a straw. The straw again fits in a
small tapered hole in the doll's lips. The liquid is conducted thru a tube in
the body of the doll to a diaper exit as in the well known diaper Dy-Dee doll.
Suction may be attained in one of the several ways. The well known suction pump
which connects to a water supply (running) may be employed (utilizing the
Bernoulli principle of pressure drop at the down stream end.).

### Page 40
The syphon phenomenon may be employed

### Page 41
Dec. 4, 1949 with the source of liquid higher than the exit or down stream end
of the interval tubing in the doll. A flexible tubing straw would probably be
needed to simplify the syphon action. A small pump operated by a spring wound
motor may also be employed. A spring loaded suction piston or diaphram may be
employed (see pp. 50, 54). The piston would be so arranged that the liquid would
be drawn by the piston ~~ rather th ~~ into the cylinder rather than forced out.
Drinking Doll (Simulated) This doll ~~ is so ~~and the associated mechanism is
so made that it appears to be drinking a liquid. The following sketch will
clarify. Sketch:

The invention operates as follows. A standard doll (1) sits facing a bowl, cup,
etc.

Dec. 4, 1949 (2) signifies a small hole in the lips into which fits (3) a glass
tube which is the tube of the bubble-light described on page 15 (re- Carl W .
Otis patents) The bubble light extends into a glass (5) and, if necessary, into
the base (8) to conceal its generating mechanism (6) and (7). This is not shown
positioned in the base (8) in the sketch. If it is placed in the base (8), the
drinking glass or bottle (5) may be of a clear or opaque material. (9)
represents a wall plug to activate the mechanism and generate large bubbles
which give the effect of drinking. Batteries could possibly be employed to heat
an element which would generate the bubbles; the bubbles could be generated by
chemical action in the liquid or by chemical action to heat the liquid (rep re:
pp. 42-43) Omit A fourth method to generate bubbles would be to fill a reservoir
within the doll with water using a closed vessle and by a syphoning action,
allow it to flow thru the straw and into the container. Thus as each drop flows
out the end of the straw tubing, an air bubble must flow back up the tubing to
replace the volume of fluid in the storage tanks witnessed by - H. Lemelson

Bubble Light described on pp.11-13, the inventor plans to reveal the invention
to Mr. Henry Sadacca of Noma Electric Company, N.Y. for the purpose of
determining if the aforementioned would be interested in entering into an
agreement with the inventor for the further development and manufacture of the
device: In respect to this invention, the inventor wishes to record a variation
in the application of the principle. Referring to the below diagram, the
inventor suggests the placement of lucite rods (1) extending from the holes (2)
in the shell (3) to a short distance out so that immitation branches may be
placed on the tree. The lucite rods will then appear to be small blinking bulbs.
The rods may be colored a variety of colors for a Christmas tree light and bulb
effect and they may be painted opaque up to their ends

Noma Electric is quite interested in the invention, a decision being held up
pending a full reduction to practice (constructive reduction to practice) of a

Marshall also revealed that the company had experienced difficulty in causing
their bubbles (smaller than these) to flow around corners such as in the
spiraling tube and up a tube which is inclined more than 30 with the horizontal.
The inventor (myself) then suggested the following construction of the ornament,
a sketch having been made beforehand. The new idea consists of merely using
sever tubes which bubble in the tree shell each tube covering a verticle or low
spiraling (below 30) line of holes. Sketch:

Dec. 5, 1949 Variations of the Bubble Light(opaque) Applications:

I. Opaque bubble light placed in front of slot in shell. This application
   produces the effect so that the bubbles themselves will be seen to rise while
   the rest of the opaque liquid keeps out the light behind or inside of the
   ornamental shell. The following sketch will help to clarify:

Viewer I Viewer

The observer at (1) looks at slot (6) in container (3) inside of which are
mounted my opaque bubble lights each effectively covering a slot such as (6).
The opaque liquid in the bubble light (2) is thus viewed thru the slot. A light
bulb (5) supplies the light which penetrate thru the bubbles as they ascend. The
inventor wishes to make it clear

### Page 45
Dec.5.49 that there are numerous variations in the application of this principle
One application involves placing the bubble lamps ~~ in ~~ behind slots in a
shell which is placed in a glass to represent the liquid efforvesing or bubbling
such as in a glass of CocaCola, etc. Of the outer display glass is translucent
and colored a dark brown or other color, the effect of the traveling bubbles in
the opaque liquid and permitting light to pass thru them as they ascend is like
the bubbling in a glass of cola or other carbonated drink. The invention can
thus be applied to any toy or small display advertizing unit which requires a
cheap method of blinking tiny lights on and off or a rising light bounce for
optical effect such as bubbles in a liquid, etc. A miniature toy such as the
movie house with twinkling or blinking lights described on page 14 will now be
expanded a bit upon. The sketch on page 67., (1) represents a toy frame of a
theater made of plastic; wood, metal sheet or other light material (2)
represents its sign which is made to resemble the blinking sign of the average

movie theater by application of the opaque bubble light and hole or slot effect.
The effect of a row of light blinking on and off may be attained by placing a
series of small holes in a row at close intervals to each other. The holes (3)
in the sign (2) are shown. A plug 6, is attached to an extention coard (5) which
in turn receives the bubble light plug (7) (4). Sketch.

Witnessed: H Lemelson 12/7/49 Dec. 6, 1969 Conception of Utilization of The
Bubble Effect

The author learned today from a member of the Kenttee Company, a firm which
manufactures glass ornaments that the bubble effect may be obtained in a tube by
the heat from the body and hand. Construction is as follows:

Glass tube Liquid with ~~ low boiling ~~ high vapor pressure probably CC14 with
some Bromine Added. also ~~ high ~~ low boiling temperature (JHL Dec. 9, 1949)
Heat of hand warms vapor in expansion chamber Chamber restriction

69 Dec. 6, 1949 Utilization of the Tube with the Following Device:

(1) Top to Glass (2) Expansion Chamber (3) Colored Opaque or Translucent or
transparent liquid to simulate milk, soft drinks, etc (4) Bubble Tube (5)
Restriction Glass Drinking Mug

The expansion chamber (5) is located in the handle of the mug so that when ~~
some ~~ user picks up mug, bubbles in tube (4) which simulate a straw rise. The
tube(4) ~~ sub ~~ is supported by either a false top(1) as shown or a false
liquid surface in the glass of glass or plastic. Jarome Lemelson Dec. 6 1949 The
same principle can be applied to a glass of milk with simulated bubbles The
chamber would be in contact with the side and the base of glass so that holding
in hand will cause bubble to be generated.

A standard heat type bubble tube which will react to the warmth of the human
body. An experiment consisting of a bubble tube (1), an expansion chamber (2), a
restricted or necked down section (3) and the low vapor pressure liquid (6) is
sewn into the top of a boys cap or hat (5). (4) Signifies material used to hold
the chamber (2) and tube in place. An experiment by the inventor has shown that
the heat given off from the human head thru the hair and also thru a piece of
cloth is sufficient to start and

Dec. 7, 1949 maintain the bubble effect. Thus the wearer of the cap has a device
which continually bubbles while he is wearing it. The device w ~~ device and cap
will be further developed. Jerome Lemelson Dec. 7, 1949 Witnessed by: H.

Dec.10-1949 Five hours were devoted last nite in an attempt to construct a
bubble tube of the type mentioned on page 68. Though the tube is already known
to operate successfully, the author wishes to make one for experimentation with
devices such as those mentioned on pp. 11, 12, 63, 64. (i.e. with a black opaque
dye dissolved in the liquid). Although a vacuum pump was employed, it was
impossible to evacuate enough air for body heat to generate bubbles. The
experiments will continue utilizing liquid nitrogen to first freeze the liquid
in the tube before applying the vacuum pump and sealing the glass tube.
Construction of a device similar to that sketched on p. 65 and 67 to illustrate
the feasibility of using bubbles in an opaque liquid to give a blinking light
effect when the tube containing the liquid (~~bubbling with  generating large
enough bubbles) is placed before a series of holes or a slot has been completed.
Operation of the unit proves that the desired effect is obtained. Jerome
Lemelson Witnessed: Howard Lemelson Dec. 10-49 Dec. 14, 1949 December 14, 1949
Two hours were devoted this evening to the reduction (constructive) to practice
of the bubble blinking ornament described on pp. 11, 12. Attempts to vacuum seal
the liquid

in a tube by freezing in liquid nitrogen failed due to poor connection to the
vacuum pump and boiling or evaporation of the frozen liquid when the torch was
applied. To be continued Conception of Inventions: The following December 16,
1949 The following inventions were conceived by the author about a week ago and
are now being entered for the first time. Doll With Heartbeat: This inventions
consists of a mechanical means for simulating heartbeat in a doll such as a wind
up mechanism which releases ~~ and an escapement operating at heart beat
interval (about 72 per minute) which released an arm to strike against a small
drum. the inventor intends to put the wind-up mechanism in the leg or arm of the
doll so that when either of these limbs are pumped about the knee or elbow
joints, the mechanism will automatically wind up the doll. The mechanism will be
made with a tension release so that it is impossible for the child to over wind
the toy and break the spring or mechanism.

its stay, a trigger is tripped which sets in motion the wind up mechanism
winding up the string into the hand. The cycle is repeated when the ~~ top of
the ~~ yoo-yo reaches the top of its travel. (2) By a button places in the rear
of the dolls' back which, when pressed by the child, releases the yo-yo and at
the same time winds up a spring sufficiently to return the yo-yo to its up
position. Witnessed: 12/29/49 Howard Sketches:

operation is wound in similar ways to those discussed on Dec 16, 1949 pp 74-75
Magnetic Skii Jumper: This toy consists of a toy figure of a skiier of a light
material which is made to slide down a skii run and which is effected by an
electromagnet which repells or attracts the device which also has magnets in its
own base. By varying the amount of current through the electro magnets its
strength may be varied and hence controls the range of the jumper by repelling
him just before he leaves the ski jump. This may be illustrated as follows:

December 19, 1949 Improvements and Variations on Invention on page 11, 12, 64,
65. The author has conceived of new applications of the opaque bubble light and
the effect produced - which involves some material changes and design
alterations in the original invention. The new application consists of
combining the opaque bubble tube with neon, argon, fluorescent or other such
light emitting gas filled tubing in such a way that an effect is produced
wherebye  the bubbles, traveling along the tube, appear as a series of moving
lights by having a continual lighted back piece (the fluorescent or neon tube).
Construction could be as follows: depicts "FRONT" and "Side View" each labelled
respectively. The "Side View" has the following corresponding labels written
with arrows gesturing to each respective piece; -2 -Fluorescent or Neon Tube (1)
-Bubbles -4 Figure 2  depicts a similar drawing with the following corresponding
labels written with arrows gesturing to each respective piece; -2 -Flurescent
light (1) -3 -4 depicts a third drawing on the second page, beside the next
paragraph. It is labelled with numbers 1-4. Figure 1 shows a simple construction
of the device involving two tubes, (1) a fluorescent (neon) tube backs the
standard bubble tube (2) described on pp  11, 12 as containing an opaque liquid
3. The fluorescent tube may be covered with a black paint or other opaque
material on its sides and back so the only light visible to an observer is that
shining through the bubbles (3). For advertising purposes where this device may
be used to make signs 'dynamic', a heating element may be used to generate
bubbles and drive them through the solution. Jerome Lemelson Dec. 19, 49

Jan 2, 1950 On Saturday Dec. 31 purchased 1.85 worth of plastics for experiments
with bubble tubes on p.p. 68 - 71. Also purchased black dyes for inventions on
pp. 62 - 68. (Blinking effect) J Lemelson  Dec  Jan 2 '50

January 2, 1950 Nine hours of experimentation today with the bubble tube
described on pp - 12, 60 - 69, 70 and 71 involved the use of a vacuum pump, a,
Tconnection with shut off valves, CC14, and necessary glass tubing and working
tools. Several tubes containing CC14 as the bubbling liquid were made to operate
successfully by heat from the hand. It was discovered that the beck down section
in the bubble tube (restriction, re: pp. 68-72) can connect to a section which
is in line with the bubble tube provided that the restriction is the right
diameter. Diagram : B - Tube; Bubbles in Liquid; A - Restriction; C Chamber.
This operates quite satisfactory, particularly if the heat is applied to A. The
bubbles are large and numerous if the Chamber C is just brought in contact with
an electric bulb or placed above the bulb. The heat of the hand will also work
quite well. With this knowledge, the inventor has conceived of the following
construction for a bubble cap device first described on pp. 70 and 71 Referring
to the sketch on the next page; (1) is the bubble tube with liquid

H-Lemelson 5, Jan 3, 1950 Since a black (opaque) liquid in the heavier (larger
diameter) tube may prevent the transmittal of light due to the liquid flowing
down the side of the tube, the following tubing construction is conceived as a
poseable solution to the problem. Crosssectional views of :

The shaded areas (1),(2) and (3) refer to small channels in the tubing thru
which the opaque liquid may flow as the buble rises thus permitting the entire
area (x) to be clear to allow light to pass thru tube. Of the tube is titled a
off horizontal, the device will work even better. Titling ordinary round tubing
(with opaque liquid bubbling) alows a clear bubble to flow with the liquid
passing down the side tilted. Jerome Lemelson Jan . 3 - 1950 Witnessed Jan 5,

May not have fully explained it to him. With respected to the heated shoe (first
mentioned on p. 10 of this book), the inventor has conceived of the following
design modifications Chemically Heated Shoe: 1. The use of a cartridge
containing ingredients which will react in a similar manner to those in the
"thermal" process. This would be placed in a cavity in the shoe and caused to
react when needed by a spring mechanism (Note- similar to the capsule now used
to heat soldering iron) In order for this to work properly (r.e.- conduction of
heat to all parts of the sole and bottom of the foot, the following construction
would be a possible solution. See figure on next page. The cartridge, a long
flat container, is placed in the cavity in the sole through opening(1). It is
then started to react and heat is conducted through (2) to the inner part of
shoe. An insulating Witnessed by: H. Lemelson Jan 30, 1950

March 13, 1950 Conception of Invention: Title: Compact Plastic Processing Unit
Uses: For filling life rafts and the like with spongy plastic to make it non
sinkable and puncture proof. also for use camping equipment such a tent and hut
flooring, insulation etc This invention is conceived with light spongy plastics
such as Lockfoam (Lockheed Aircraft), stearofoam, etc which are used for
insulation; etc. and particularly those which ~~ are processed ~~ require heat
for processing. The author has conceived of a method and device for making this
plastic in an emergency or Witnessed by Howard Lemelson April 16, 1950

### Page 63
March 13, 1950 when needed for use in the field. Plastics such as Lockfoam, for
example, are first mixed and available in liquid form. When heated (exact
temperatures vary with plastic) they expand to as much as 25 or more times their
original volume and are composed of a cellular structure in which air is trapped
thus making a fine insulating material or filler for life preservers, life
boats, etc. The following sketch is a preliminary design of a compact unit for
the production of this plastic in its expanded form so that it may be made
easily outside of the laboratory or factory with a minimum of effort.

For a description of the unit I refer to the above sketch. The unit is housed in
Witnessed by H. Lemelson April 16, 1950

March 13, 1950 a container (1) which is shown in crossection. The container
contains an inner container (2). Which is surrounded by a chemical or chemicals
(3) for the production of an exotheric reaction. If thermite or similar
chemicals are used, an igniter (5) may be utilized to start the exothermic
reactions to produce heat. If two reacting chemicals are utilized they may be
kept apart be partitions or separate containers. In this latter case, their
bringlong together by breaking the partition or one of the containers may be
accomplished by a hammer tap or other means which may be manually done or
automatically through a mechanism. Once heat is generated around container (2),
stopper may either melt or be forced out by the pressure within (2) as the
plastic expands, thus filling whatever space is desired. One or more of these
units may be placed in a deflated life raft for example. When it is desired to
inflate the raft (in an emergency for example) a C02 cartridge may be triggered,
the same action triggering this unit for the production of the plastic which
fills the raft thus making it punctureproof (over) Witnessed by Howard Lemelson
April 16, 1950

### Page 64
March 13, 1950 Another use may be in a compact artic tent where insulation is
needed for the flooring. In this case, the unit would be placed in a deflated
bag for use when needed. The unit may also be used for wall insulation in homes,
etc, for toys wherein it fills a baloon to make a permanent toy baloon shape. To
be further investigated Jerome Lemelson March 13, 1950 April 16, 1950 Note: The
interval between Mar. 13 and Apr. 16 during which time no entries were made in
this book was due to (1) the inventor studying for examinations, (2) magazine
article committments and (3) a 10 day vacation. The following devices were
conceived during the aforementioned interval and are recorded now for the first
time. #1 Tire Handling Device: This device is intended to be used to simplify
the changing of tires by the car operator when a flat tire occurs on the road.
It provides (a) a means for handling the spare and blown out tire with minimum
effort and lessened Witnessed by: H. Lemelson April 16, 1950

chance or dirtying hands and clothing and (2) a means for positioning the tire
prior to placing it on the wheel hub. A sketch will suffice:

The device consists of a frame of steel tubing which fits around the auto wheel,
said wheel resting on spindle (1) which goes thru center hole in tire hub. The
frame consists of bars (5) and (4) which are joined at 6 so that they may freely
rotate with respect to each other (2) is a pivoting support bar which supports
(4) thus holding the tire off the ground while it is being prepositioned before
the ~~ wheel ~~ axle hub. Lateral tipping is prevented by a bend (7) in (5)
which rests on the ground. The tire may be pulled up off the ground by handle
(8). A screw in 5 at the bend (7) threads into bolt (3) end when Witnessed by:
Howard Lemelson April 16, 1950

### Page 65
April 16 1950 it is desired to more the tire over the ground by use of the
frame. #2. Automatic Car Jack: This device is a small portable car jack of the
type utilized to change tires and utilizes the pressure stored in a small
cartridge (such as a CO2 cartridge) to do work on a piston and hence raise the
jack and the car. This would require (1) a cartridge contain gas at sufficient
pressure to do the required amount of work (2) A piston (sealed) on which the
gas (expanding) can work (3) a valve for regulating the flow of gas into the
cylinder containing the piston (4) Possibly a means for creating the proper
mechanical advantage necessary (possibly two pistons) (5) a means for releasing
said pressure after the job is done so as to lower the bumper slowly, (6) a
means for allowing the gas in the cartridge to escape and flow thru the system
so as to do work on the piston (7) a safety one way regulator in the event of a
leak in the system. To be continued #3 Device (Machine) for Manufacturing bubble
tubes: The inventor has conceived of a new technique for mass producing bubble
tubes, Witnessed by: Howard Lemelson April 16, 1950

April 16, 1950 particularly in the manufacture of tubes of plastic material.
However, the method may also be utilized for glass tube manufacture. The
following is a simple sketch of the basic elements involved:

(1) Refers to the walls of the container or tube which is filled with the liquid
(2) of high vapor pressure low boiling temp. An injection nozzle (3) has a ring
(4) or neopreen or other flexible material which is not affected by the liquid
(2), (4) fitting snugly in a groove in (3) as shown and having an outer diameter
greater than the inner diameter (9) of the tube or container. A hole (6) is
drilled near the perimeter of the tube (6) which exits at (7) and is used to
allow trapped air and liquid to escape from (1) This hole is closed off at (7)
at the proper instant by a stop such as the slide valve arrangement (5) shown.
Action is as follows. Liquid (2) is placed in said tube or container (1) so that
is nearly filled. witnessed by H. Lemelson April 16, 1950

April 16-1950 (3) is then inserted on ring(4) is compressed so as to make a
tight seal in (1). The Tube(3) is then pushed forward until liquid begins to
flow thru(6). This hole (6) is then stopped up at(7) by slide valve(5). The
tube(3) is then drawn out a short distance so that a partial vacuum space
appears somewhere in (1). A liquid material is next injected thru hole(8) and it
solidifies, sealing off(1) from the atmosphere(3) is withdrawn after (10)
solidified sufficiently. Jerome Lemelson April 16-1950 Witnessed by: Howard

Conception of Invention: Automobile Washing devices. (over)

The following devices for washing automobiles and the like have been conceived
by the author. (1) Automatic car washer: This consists of a device which is
attached to the automobile (i.e. for example under the running brand) continued
on Mar. 22-1950 (delay due to business committments). and which is operated
either automatically or manually to clean the outer surface or body of the
automobile. The author (inventor) wishes to accomplish the job of cleaning the
car with a minimum use of water, in a short period of time and with minimum
effort on the part of the car owner. This is accomplished by (1) use of a fine
cleaning spray over the surface of the car positioned so that the spray orifice
is as close to the surface of the car. The following sketch will illustrate how
this may be accomplished in one way.

The above sketch is considered self explanatory for the present. Note that this
device may be used as a manual manipulated cleaner which may be

March 22-50 Conception of Device For Cooling Flash bulbs which are used for
internal photography (within the human body): The inventor has been informed
that present methods of photographing the inside of a person prior to operating
involved the use of a flash bulb which must be intense in light energy for a
least 1/25th of a second. With the present technique the patient may receive an
internal burn which may be painful and harmful to him. The author has conceived
of the following method of cooling said bulb after it has flashed for the
photograph. The inventor wished to discipate the heat generated (most of it) by
setting up an endothermic reaction immediately after the bulb has fired and
positioned so as to the discipate most of the heat before harm is done to the
patient. Sketch of invention (preliminary design sketch)

Referring to the above skech which is a basic or primary description of the
components,

### Page 68
May 22, 1950 the light bulb (flash bulb) is connected by wires 7 to an source of
energy and switch outside the body of the patient and is encased in transparent
vial 8 so that light may penetrate (when the bulb is fired) to the ~~ various ~~
desired area. At the same instant the bulb is fired, a valve (2) is opened
allowing a fluid in chamber ~~ one ~~ (1) to enter chamber 3. A quick flow into
chamber 3 may be had by use of a liquid 9 such as Freon or other liquid with a
high vapor pressure. At the same time, valve 4 opens allowing chemical in
chamber 6 to react with liquid in chamber 3 (from chamber 1) said  reaction
being endothermic and of sufficient degree to permit discipation of heat from
bulb (5). Another possible arrangement of this device

(1) refers to chamber filled with one ~~ endothermic ~~ chemical which reacts in
chamber 8 with other chemical from chamber (2) when valve 3 is opened thus
discipating heat from bulb 5 when fired - Valve 3 may be operated by small
solenoid J. Lemelson witness H. Lemelson May 22, 1950

valve operating when point is pressed lightly against writing surface. 2. Spray
nozzles and the like: This invention consists of shaped spray nozzles made of a
porous material such as a porous material or ceramic of the correct porosity and
shape to allow for correct spray. 3. Welding Device: The object of this
invention is to provide a  of welding and poss  whereby the user may spot weld
witnessed by: Howard Lemelson, July 31,1950 Page 113 July 9,1950 thin metal
sheet and other shaped metal parts without the use of welding gases or
electricity. This device consists of a gun or instrument for dispensing a
cartridge, said cartridge containing a mixture of chemicals which will react ing
with a welding metal exothermically so as to melt said metal, at the same time
heating up the part to be welded to a sufficient temperature to allow
spotwelding of the parts, said exothermic reaction triggered by a firing pin
which sets off a fuse, said cartridge being displaced and fired by said gun;
said cartridge being held near the point of application by a clamp or jaws which
are part of said gun and made of a material such as a ceramic or other material
which will not fuse with said cartridge when it is reacting. The exothermic
reaction may  be  consist of chemicals such as  and other materials if
necessary. The inventor will discuss this matter further with a metallurgist

not in use has been a problem up to now and it is hoped to be solved by either a
mechanical means or by depressurizing the reservoir of ink (just above the
reservoir) To be continued. Jerome Lemelson Sept. 29, 1950 Witnessed by: Howard
Lemelson Aug. 29, 1950 Sep. 1, 1950 The tests on the pens (pp. 111, 112) are
continuing. The pen now writing is the one which I wrote with above. It still
has not clogged with Stratford 8025 ink. Conception of Invention About a month
ago the author conceived of the following invention and he is now running tests
on some. If a material which is not soluble in water such as cellulose acetate,
pt nitrate, vinylite, paints, etc. is placed (bonded) to a bar of soap and the
soap used, the effect will be to prevent the soap from

### Page 75
Soap:  Sept. 1, 1950 dissolving directly below the material For example, the
author has painted a strip of cellulose acetate ~~ d ~~ on a flat surface of a
bar of soap. After using the soap for a while, it wore away except under the
painted strip leaving a ridge. The following applications are thus possible: (1)
Printing of letters or designs on bar soap in colored or clear plastic or other
non-soluble (water) material for decorative purposes and for advertizing the
brand name of the soap. The lettering and designs will remain and become more
bold as the soap is used (2) Protecting engravings in the soap by coating with a
wear plastic. (3) Shaping the soap (as it is used) by printing or applying
plastics or other non-soluble material. For example - if lateral shaping, strips
are ~~ sh ~~ painted on a bar of soap, after a certain amount of use. Lateral
ridges will be formed making the bar slipproof and easier to handle. Jerome
Lemelson Sept. 1, 1950 Witnessed by: Howard Lemelson, Sept. 4, 1950

September 7, 1950 Referring to the soap design invention on 121, 122 - tests
have revealed that wax dripped or placed on soap while molten will adhere to it
nicely and will serve the purposes set fourth on p. 121. As for the porous pens,
this one is still writing nicely and has been doing so since Sept. 29, 1950. The
author conceives of the following construction to keep ink out of the point when
verticle and not in use.

The soft material on the top is pressed against the porous part by gravity
preventing flow of ink thru point. By shaking, the user allows some ink to flow
to point. J. Lemelson Sept. 7, 1950 September 20, 1950 This is a sample of
writing with a porous pen containing a mixture of diazine black S.S. dye in
water. The pen has been writing now

### Page 76
for about 4 days without clogging so far. The following structure may prevent
any clogging due to paper.

Sintered metel Porous point (sealed in this area by gringing or a coating or
plating) This area on surface of pen is not sealed allowing ink to flow ~~ over
~~ from an area greater than point alone. J Lemelson Sept. 20,1950 Note. This
ink appears to be the best so far. A very small amount is dissolved in a large
quantity of water. JHL. Sept.20-50 Sept. 22, 1950 The above pen ceased writing
today. It is the opinion of the author that this is due either to surface
corosion or clogging near the surface; the possibility of it being due to paper
clogging having been eliminated: It is therefore suggested & will be carried out
that a wet tip test be run and a tip of sintered stainless steel be tried out J.
Lemelson Sept. 22, 1950

October 1, 1950 This pen has been writing now for two weeks. The tip has been
kept wet and this may be one possible solution to the problem. Any technique
which ~~ can ~~ will keep the surface of the point away from exposure to
atmosphere air may solve the problem. Capping the pen may suffice. JHL. Oct.

RECORD OF Conception of Invention: Title: MAgnetic Toy Derrick: & RELEASE
MECHANISM: Description: This toy relates to a derrick which utilizes a magnet
(permanent) to pick up toys or objects of a magnetically susceptible material
and means for releasing said objects without demagnetization. a temporary magnet
has been utilized before & in the art to accomplish this end but this requires a
source of electrical energy, usually a battery which may be worn out rapidly due
to the large current drain by the coil of the magnet. and the constant switching
on and off. Sketch:

In the drawing, a permanent magnet 1 is

### Page 12
placed in a housing 2 (of non-magnetically susceptible material) which is
secured to or part of a toy derrick arm 10. A panel 5 acts as a cover to this
housing and is spring loaded in an open position (as shown) to expose the magnet
1. The panel 5 is connected to a flexible cord ~~8 ~~ 7 at 6 and may be
triggered or released by the operator of the toy to slide over the surface of
the magnet therebye forcing (3) the object which has been picked up off the
magnet and effecting a release. J H L. Oct. 11, 1950 Conception of Invention:
Title: Bubble Blowing Pull Toy: While the following mechansim for this toy are
not worked out in exact detail below they serve to give a description- of the
general principles involved. The idea is to design a pull type toy which has the
proper mechanism for creating & blowing bubbles as the wheels of the toy turn
when the toy is rolled along the ground or pulled. In the sketch on the
following page (over).

October 11, 1950

A wire ring 1 is dipped into bubble liquid reservoir 2 by action of crank 5
which is connected to bend in axle 3, said bend 3 rotates as wheels 8 rotate.
Crank 6 also operating off axle 3 is connected to split shaft 4 which actuates
bellows 2. blowing stream of air thru ring and forming bubbles from film on ring

Lemelson Oct. 11, 1950 Oct. 13, 1950 Expanded Plastic Lifereaft (pp. 99,-100
book 1) was described today to Ira Richlin, 945 W. End Ave.

Today Mr. Cantor of Automatic Toy Co. was shown the magnetic target games (pp.
38 ff.) and a more complete model is being prepared for him. He was also shown
the sipping and (draining toy which closes an electrical contact when child
drinks) which he did not approve of. Also present in his office was an inventor
of inverted drap hanging mechanism which Cantor may manufacture.) The magnetic
toy derrick + release (p. 12) may also be made as  constructed as follows —

A magnet 1 picks up toy b. When it is ready to be released, cable or rod 4 is
pulled in direction of arrow drawing magnet into hole and forcing off toy 6. 2

October 28, 1950 The following device for remote (under the board) magnetic
control (see nov. 27, 1949) has been conceived and recorded prior to this in a
self addressed The system of moving magnets about under a thing board or playing
surface so as to move magnets in their braced about on the playing surface has
been derived. Prior (?conederations)untied a vehicle and track placed under the
board. This system utilized a belt and service of pulleys. To facilitate motion
of the belt with attached magnets, a flat belt is utilized with pulley designed
as follows. First diagram on left; reading left to right: "Playing surface,

Labels include: Belt Pulley Surface Magnet Belt Groove Pulley in cross section
Groove for magnet Oct. 28, 1950 Conception Idea: Whistling Light-up Toy —
Utilizes a switch which closes when operator blows into whistle and activates or
throws on a light in toy. (See self-addressed letter) Nov. 1, 1950 Magnetic
Switch Toy: See notebook #1 (Feb. 26, 1950) for first conception date. A
completed switch which works was completed in July and it is now being applied
to various toys and games, some of which are recorded in a mailed letter and
witnessed description (i.e. toy mine detector; toy Geiger Counter (simulated);
toy simulated electric eye; etc.).Drawings… (patent drawings) have been made and
a pat. application is in process. The author conceives that this switch may be
operated not only by magnetic attraction or repulsion from or towards the
working surface of the toy by an approaching magnet but also by motion of the
moving contact swinging (in direction lateral to the surface of the toy) or in a
direction which is radial or an axis perpendicular to the playing surface, viz:
(drawing labeled with parts 1–7) (1) Lateral to Surface: Lead in (1) connects to
stationary contact (2). Moving contact (3) has a magnet secured to it and is
caused to swing towards stationary contact (2) when magnet (7) is moved in
direction of arrow (5). (5) is lead in wire to moving contact and (6) designates
a pivot or anchor

consist of an annular ring so that (7) may merely approach (4) from any
direction for contact to be made. Above and that on page (17) have disadvantage
of not allowing a prolonged circuit closure as is that shown on page 95 of book
I. By: James H. Hamlin Note: Model of (?) p.88 book 1: Jan. 16, 1950 was
completed a month ago and will be shown to Mr. Baggott of Ideal Toy + Novelty
Co. It has also been shown to Mr. Cantor of Automatic Toy Co. who was not
interested and Mr. Marshall (drawing) of Noma Electric Co. Nov. 1, 1950.

Record of Conception of Invention: Imitation Toy Radar Set + game A toy scope I
set in a cabinet (2) has images flass across it either from a projection of a
shadow from film in optical system of (?) bulb 6 or motion of a motor driven
screen across scope (3). If the screen is utilized, scoring may be accomplished
by pointer 3' which is adjustable by knob (3) and which makes contact with
figures (5) which are painted with conductive paint and have stripes of paint
leading to a band on the side which makes contact with another slider completing
the circuit. (over)

### Page 17
(real radar) (similar real radar) To give a ~~moving effect~~ to the screen, the
scanner may have a varying degree of opaqueness with periphery by:  scanning
green (rotates) when motor is running) clear varying degree of opaqueness around

To give a moving effect to the objects, a period of bright and dark lines placed
on the scanning screen or on the scope face intermeshes with the objects on the
moving screen which are so as to give a dynamic effect (partially old art). When
light is flashed thru the transparent lines the effect is similar to real radar.
To be developed. J Lemelson Nov. 1, 1950 Nov. 2, 1950 The latest model of the
suspended magnetic target game (See book 1, p91 - Feb. 3, 1950) has completed
for Mr.Comtor of Automate Toy company. A search has been made from the Patents
gone three on target games the author believes this game is definitely
patentable. The game consists of a series of magnetic targets anchored to a base
by a flexible cord and suspended in place below other magnets. Means are
supplied for automatically suspending the targes below the magnet once they have
been knocked out of the field. Said means consist of a bar or strip with holes
in it thru which the magnet cord extends riding on dowels or rods in a verticle
plane with means of or raising the bar (with a lever or by merely packing it up
by hand) said action positioning each magnet directly below its suspending
magnet which is mounted on a cross bar. The first model was completed in July
but not recorded JHLemelson Nov,3,1950 Witnessed by H.Lemelson Nov. 10, 1950
Worked today on above mentioned target for a model for Ideal Toy and Novelty Co.
Mr. Baggot their chief engineer was informed in a personal interview of its
workshop. He expressed desires to see a model, liked the idea very much. He was
~~ las ~~ also shown (Nov 2.) drawings of

### Page 18
the egg (p.37 book 1) which springs apart when a toy chicken is placed on it, of
the convection operated lamps (tree) p 88 loops, and the crembing  device with
seventh  (recorded by mail) of which a model has been completed. Also ~~ woke ~~
have been working on (and did some work today) on a magnetic release (dated by
mail) which permits a spring loaded device to operate when a magnet is brought
near the release or may be used to operate ~~ an ~~ spring motor when a magnet
approaches the release. This latter device has been completed & will be applied
to toys. Also worked on magnetic electrical outlet for toys and the like (p 95
Feb .5, 1950 book 1) completing 3 switches; one for a toy geiger counter and one
for a mine detector game. Conception of Formations (1.) Printed circuits  for
Toy Traction. The following method of making toy roadhills, tracks, traction
surfaces etc. Is conceived as a cheap, simple appraoch to the problem of toy
vehicle control and traction. The technique would consist of printing ~~ spp ~~
sputtering, impressing a string or other method of applying a thin metallic

sheet, film or strip to a non metallic surface such as a plastic sheet, wood,
etc which ~~ to ~~ may be shaped so that a toy vehicle ~~ will ~~ (powered by an
electric motor) will seem in a desired direction ~~ down an in ~~. Said
construction would involved the use of two such strips in paralell so that
contact with these strips by the wheels of the vehicle or by other rolling or
sliding contacts will be made to supply current to the motor in the vehicle. The

utilized to apply a metallic coating or strip to a non- conducting surface. 26
such individual methods are tested in National Bureau of Standard Miscellaneous
Publication #192. which includes such techniques as painting,  and spraying
conductive paints and plastics bonded powders, sputtering,

spraying molten metal & , die- cutting foil or sheet metal and attaching with
rivets staples, cement or impressing into molten or soft plastic sheet, etc. It

call today to Mr. Payne, who was quite interested in the device will verify if
the manager or owner of the company will desire to manufacture the item. A
search of my records has revealed that I possibly may have failed by error to
record this invention in detail prior to this date. the device was conceived
about the end of September 1950, a model was completed week later and a patent
drawing was completed about a week ago and copies were made by photostating. One
copy is missing from my files and I may have mailed this to my self though
misplaced it. I recall making a sketch & description which I will search for. I
am preparing a patent application on the device, at present working on the

~~prepositioning~~ attracting a series of oblong objects such as rubber stamps
(hand operated) to a rack~~s~~ and holding in place by the use of magnets, said
objects extending in a generally downward direction (hanging down), with means
provided for prepositioning each oblong object and preventing lateral
displacement. The combination of this means holding said object from swinging
sidewards or positioning in racks plus the magnetic attraction makes a simple
easy to use holding device. Said means for prepositioning and preventing lateral
displacement or swing may consist of a strip of metal at right angles to the
contact surface and circumventing the object near its upper end or
semicircumventing it if it is desired to position the object from the side, A
sketch of a typical stamp rack would be

as follows: (Similar to one of pat. drawings)

In the above drawings: a rubber stamp 1 contains a magnet 4 attached to its
handle (in the ~~ t ~~ upper end) so as to permit the stamp to hang from a
magnetically susceptible material or surface. The rack shelf 3 is of this
magnetically susceptible material or may be

attached in it around the perimeter where objects are to hang. Semi-circular
strip 2 is used as a prepositioner, and it may extend beyond the edge of 3 so
that the user turning top may has his positioning of 1 simplified. The above
rack may also be applicable to tools and the like, or any oblong objects that
can be hung by magnets. Jerome Lemelson Nov. 10, 1950 Witnessed by: H Lemelson

a month or two ago with the same device and he advised Mr. Thomas to get his
patent application first. He claimed that this Thomas had filed an application.
As a result Molin refused to give me a letter to the effect that he has seen my

May 6,1951 The following application of a free piston engine device has been
conceived. It is conceived that the free piston engine may be utilized to do
work of an oscillating nature - i.e - apply an intermittent force such as in (1)
a rivet gun (2) "compressed air" type hammer (Joels hammer), etc. The
arrangement in its simplest form would be something like the following

In the above figure, A+B refers to pistons connected by rod (1), Fuel and air
are injected into cylinder head areas (J) + (K) and ignited by spark plugs (S).
F+E refer to ~~ slide ~~ exhaust ports which are uncovered by pistons as they
advance away from head. (I) refers to ~~ spaces ~~ volumes between baffle (L)
which separates the two chambers from each other. The compression in these
volumes due to each piston advancing against plate (L) may be utilized to pum a
fluid to do work, to pump air or gases to cool the engine, to compress a fuel
for May 6-1951 fuel injection into each cylinder head, to compress an ignitable
fuel air mixture which will do work in compressing the pa gases for the next
stroke, etc Rod H extends thru a hole(well sealed) in (M) cylinder head and is
utilized to due work as the pistons oscillate back & forth. A single piston
arrangement is Spring In the drawing, Piston (P) is rigidly connected to shaft
(H) and loaded against spring (K) to maintain top dead center position
(compression) fuel is injected thru fuel injection system together with air (air
may come in thru a subpiston (not shown) in (P). which opens on the upstrobe
when ignition plug (S) explodes piston compress spring (K) when it reaches its
botton dead position it has already

slid past exhaust port (E) exhausting gases. The spring then returns the piston
to its top position, compressing incoming gases. Shaft H provides the oscilating
jabbing motion for work during operation. Note: Diaphram type metallic spring
may be  in place of coil spring shown. Volume V may be  for pumping. By Jerome
Lemelson May 6- 1951 Witnessed by: Howard Lemelson May 6, 1951 May 23- 1951 Free
Piston Engine Electric Generator It is conceived that the free-piston type
internal combustion engine may be utilized ~~ to ~~ in combination with the
necessary current producing components to produce an alternating or direct
current. Since this involves considerable development & design work ~~ in volume
~~ to arrive at an optimum operating current generating unit, only the basic
ideas for the designs will be presented at this time in this notebook pending
further ~~ full se ~~ design consideration by the inventor.

May 23-1951 The inventor is aware of prior free piston engine development by the
French Inventor Pescara whose firm has manufactured over 1000 hot air compressor
units. The free piston-type i.e. engine has numerous advantages over the
conventional piston - crank shaft engine. Simplicity of design, and fabrication,
and the possibility of ataining greater efficiencies due to less frictional
losses (no bearings, etc) and possibility of ataining higher compressibility of
fuel-air mixtures prior to ignition lable the engine type as outstanding. The
present known free piston engine designs are: A Use of two (short) free floating
pistons with combustion in three regions viz. (Pescara, German, U.S.
experimental types)

Fig. 1 In the above very simplified sketch, ~~ for ~~ a combustable mixture is
injected into zones 1, 2, & 3. This pistons oscillate back & forth as an
explosion occurs in zone 2 forcing pistons to

### Page 32
compress mixtures

### Page 33
in zones 1 & 2. At the proper instant, these mixtures are ignited forcing the
two pistons towards each other compressing a ~~ n ~~ combustible mixture forced
into that zone thru injector I2. This mixture is then ignited. forcing the
pistons away from each other again. E1, E2, E3, E4 refer to exhaust ports where
the gases are expelled or exhausted hot & at a pressure considerably greater
than atmospheric to do work. This is essentially the present day free piston
engine without the showing the more complex intake and exhaust slide valve
arragement ~~ uit ~~ utilized. If pistons 1 & 2 are designed as follows;

This whole assembly Formerly piston 1 Zone A 1a Shaft A 1b Fig. 2 it is seen
that there is a zone (Zone A) between the pistons 1a & 1b which is not in the
hot burning gas zone. If an interface or plate is places in this zone, and the
proper valving for intake and exhaust are installed, work may be done on a cold
fluid such as air, oil, etc. In addition, ~~ with ~~ Shaft A may be utilized to
do mechanical work if the interface is May 23-1951 removed. By linking or
recharge a shaft at an angle to said shaft A and extending it beyond the walls
of the engine eyelander Basic Design of Tree Piston Engine as a ColdPenny. Fig.3
shows this arrangement designed to pump cold air or fluids. The intake and
exhaust ducting are shown in very basic form. *Diagram reading left to right*
V1, V(1A) , I IB, V (1B) (1B), V2, Notevaluing is not shown from region other
than (1B) (L), E(1B) Operation may be explained as fall by looking at region 1B
between piston (1B) and separating plate (L). Combustion takes place in V2. The
assembly including piston 1B moves to the left. One way value I(1B) which is a
fluid intake value closes and exhaust value E(1B) opens permitting the fluid (as
for example) in the chambers to flow out due to the compression by piston (1B).
The combination change in region

### Page 34
V1 is then ignited forcing the assembly to the right, intake valve 1B opens
permitting fluid to be drawn in by the over expansion; at the the same time, one
way exhaust valve is forced closed. The cycle then repeats, also in the other 3
regions between the pistons and plate L. If a liquid is utilzed it may be ducted
to turn a turbine, into a fluid drive unit, do  do work as in ~~f ~~ lifting,
etc. Other components of a system utilizing a fluid would be; a hydraulic
accumulator to permit steady flow (acclimate the pulsating flour), a fluid drive
unit, etc. The designing would also include proper ducting of the unit so that
flow from each volume would follow the next for smoother flow. Use of the
freepiston engine as an impact tool has been described on pp. 40 & 41. Other
proposed uses are: a. in sawing - there is ample reciprocating oscillatory
motion to do sawing work. b. as a drill - this would require conversion of the
reciprocating motor to rotary. c. For Generating Electrical Energy: Several of
the basic design are as follows - See next page.

May 23-1951 I Placing the armature magnet (magnetic field) directly on the
piston or piston connecting shaft. Field windings would then either surround the
cylinder of the free piston engine or positioned near said cylinder or possibly
be placed inside cylinder in the zone between the pistons in such a manner that
the pistons may travel without interference One arrangement is as follows:

Since the frequency of the AC. pulses are dependent on the frequency of
oscillations of the free piston arrangements, a speed regulator device may be
necessary for constant AC. pulses, or use of a rectifier will give a direct
current. The use of sliding type brushes may enable permit use of an electro
magnet (Armature winding) to replace the permanent magnet.

### Page 35
An May 23-1951 Another arrangement is as follows. In which an extension of the
piston or (interconnecting piston rods) extends beyond the cylinder wall thru a
slot in said wall and said armature winding or permanent magnet is connected to
said extension as follows:

Motion of the permanent magnet back & forth with respect to the field windings
(which may surround the permanent magnet (slotted also) creates an alternating
current in the field circuit. Note that when compared to the conventional rotary
motor generator (combination, we see that all frictional losses in bearings,
brushes etc are not present in this arrangement More electrical energy per lb.
of fuel is derived for use. Future designs will consider complex arrangements of
the above. By Jerome Lemelson May 23, 1951 Witnessed by: Howard Lemelson May 24,

June 20-1951 The following idea was conceived today and revealed to James
Jeffress as a possible method of reducing the pressure near the exhaust of an
internal combustion engine for better scavenging. Design of the exhaust port so
that compressed gases either from the combustion chamber or from a section of
the engine in which there is a certain degree of compression pass out in the
exhaust area a high speeds therebye utilizing the principles of jet ejection to
help scavenge by reduction of pressure & carrying along exhaust gases. The

August 5-1951 (1.) Regarding a magnetic holder which was conceived last Febuary
or January and disclosed to Dr. Hett which I don't believe was recorded either
~~m~~ by mail or in this book. I intend to utilize a permanent magnet in
combination with a correct device to secure optical instruments to a ~~cast~~
magnetically attractive base such as the flat surface of an optical bed, or an
interferometer base. This would require ~~some~~mechanism for reducing the force
of attraction between the magnet in the device and the bed ~~and~~ or for
removing the former from the bed without scratching the surface or having to
exert too much direct force. I intend to do this by either using a screw or
lever arrangement to pry the magnet off the surface or by correctly engaging and
disengaging a magnet or magnetically susceptible material to reduce the power of
the holding magnet. (2.) Regarding my ~~automa~~ remote controlled doll
mechanisms (recorded by mail) which utilize a some release in combination with

Sept 3, 1951 Sept 5, 1951 To date, approximately eight hours have been devoted
to making patent of my cargo-container winch loaded on trucks (re: pp 51, 53, 58

a patent drawings JHL Sept 10-51 filed within a few weeks. Also have been
working on a design for a lifting conveyor (platform at end of conveyor is

Worked an additional two hours on the patent drawing for the cargo container.
Included in the drawings a novel method for packaging in the body of the
container itself It consists of placing a series of inflatable cells in the
container and inflating them after the cargo is placed in the container. These
would act as (a) packing which would further secure the cargo in place (b) shock
absorbing material. This too was ~~ dis ~~ disclosed to James J. Johnson last
June and it is my hope that he hasn't gone ahead with his own development of
this. From my last meeting with him I discovered that he and his associates make
their living on royalties from patents. For this reason, coupled with the fact
that he hasn't gotten in touch with me or cooperated in the patenting of these
devices I feel that there may be come collusion taking place at present. Am
going to Washington tommorow. J. Lemelson Sept 10-J Witnessed by H. Lemelson

already talked about this and he is willing. For the record, in the event that I
haven't recorded this prior to this, I discussed another inventor last February
with Dr. Helt. It was a device for clamping and (or) holding optical instruments

Oct. 18-1951 #1 The following ideas in toy blocks have been conceived and will
be shown to Milton Schataf who is production supervisor for Greyshaw, Inc. a
manufacturer of plastic toys and blocks. Drawings and photostats will be made:

Clear Block Wall Toy Block balls collect at bottom Plastic insert giving a path
down the wall of the block along which small balls or particles may travel when
the plo block is properly fitted A drawing is being made of this which will be
recorded witnessed and recorded by mail. Idea #2. Musical Blocks. It is proposed
to create musical notes in blocks or toys by having small pellets or balls,
falling from a storage space, empinge on a sounding board or bell. viz: See
diagram on next page.

### Page 45

Description: October 19th (continued) The small particles or balls A collect in
chamber C thru holes H in partition P which separates C from the main region R
of the clock and which forms a downwardly slanting chute with hold D, just large
enough to permit one ball to drop thru at a time. The balls A flow thru hole D
and strike bell or sounder B, thus causing a continuous series of sounds. To
return the balls to the chamber, the block is tilted on its head, balls A roll
thru hole A into C and the cycle is repeated. As a toy a ~~ multitude ~~ several
holes may be used with the balls of various sizes fallen thru respective holes
and impinging on different bells or sounders to give different notes. Jerome H.
Lemelson Oct 19- 1951 Oct 20-1951 witnessed by H. Lemelson Oct. 20, 1951 I saw
Ed Baggott of Ideal Toy Co. this morning and discussed and showed him drawings
of my patent on Toy . One of the things we discussed makes

Doll & Moving Mouth: About three months ago I conceived of a doll with a mouth
that moves as it utters a sound and recorded on a sheet which was mailed to
myself. As I showed this to Mr. Bagott Chief Engineer of Ideal Toy Company about
two months ago (Re: p. 56, Aug 51) and, he has not acted in good faith recently
regarding a mechanism which I suggested, I am recording variations on this as
follows: Baggott avoided the topic when I saw him on October 20th and I am
hereby recording these variations for my protection in the future. (1 Doll with
moving mouth and sounding mechanism. According to my original conception this
was to be accomplished by using a shaped or perforated tape on which an arm was
to ride, said arm the movement of the jaw when the doll talked. A simpler
arrangement would be to utilize a gravity operated sounder such as those used to
make a crying noise, which would operate the mouth moving mechanism. viz.

(Over)

### Page 46
Operation: When the doll is tilted, the bellows tends to return to its normal
position, Its weight is also connected to an arm which is connected by a bubage
arrangement to move the jaw when the weight drops. The anbage may cause one
movement or a more complex opening and closing of the lips synchronized with the
sound. (To be developed very shortly) Laughing Doll: A simple arrangement
whereby a doll could be made to laugh when shaken involves the use of a doll
cryer with preferably a base tone and a stroke so limited that a brief noise
will be emitted when the mechanism is tilted with the doll or when the doll is
shaken. The stroke of the bellows must me short so that the doll will not cry
when shaken or tilted but will give off a series of chuckle like noises when
shaken rapidly Another variation on this would be to drive said bellows with a
motor or by a mechanism activated by the childs winding or pulling a toy. By
Jerome Lemelson Oct 23-51 Witnessed by: H Lemelson Nov. 22, 1957 Note: the doll
thermometer of which I gave the drawings to Ed Baggott (Ideal Toy Co) on June 21
and a revision on August 5th still has not been decided upon by the people at
Ideal Toy. Baggott says that he well have defenite word for we wrltiy a week. He
claims that they want to put the stewy on a first aid or doll doctor bet. It
consisted of a colored legend or a table forced up by compressing a rubber bulb
at the dolls mouth or by a rod in a tube which is spring loaded and robich is
push up the tube when pushed against the dolls mouth. This is how recorded as
downwards curve submitted to Baggott who first claimed that they were influenced
and now claims that no decision has been made. Four months have clapped since
then. and of they do not let me know wether a week I will request... It seems to
me as if they are stalling. By Jerome Lemelson Oct 23-51 Witnessed by: H
Lemelson Nov. 22, 1957 Ideal Toy Co: I received the B.J Mehton sales manager of
Ideal Toy Company today. Shoved him four items normally. (1.) Pressure attached
toy cap (a patent has been filed by me on this) including an

### Page 47
embodyment mentioned in one of my claims, a toy figure part of which is
inflatable. I showed him a drawing of a toy dog with long ears that pop up when
a bulb is depressed, the dog being mounted on the crown of a cap. Although his
chief engineer, Mr. Ed Baggott liked this item, Michtom did not care for it.
Oct. 28- 1951 (continued) Other items shown Michtom were. (2) Toy Rocking Boat
Mechanism: This was given (drawings) to Mr. Baggott on June 21 1951 who held on
to them until now without giving me a ~~ n ~~ decision as to whether or not the
officials at Ideal liked it. He just said (on Oct 22 visit) that they already
have toy boats. Michtom however likes the idea and I will build a model. (3) Toy
Pull Fish that wiggles: Drawings of this were given to Baggott on June 21 who
did not return them to me until Oct 22. Michtom said he had seen a pull fish in
England. (4) Crying Blocks- Drawings were shown to Michtom. The toy consisted
essentially of a shaped toy block having a gravity-operated sounding mechanism.
Witnessed by: H. Lemelson 11/22/51 The figure engraved in the face of the block
would be represented by the sound. Preferably, the mouth of the figure would
have an opening to appear ~~of~~ as if the figure were talking. Michtom said he
had seen toy sounding books and was therefore not interested in these blocks. At
his point I would like to voice an opinion regarding disclosures over the past
year. 1 A drinking toy having a toy figure with a straw thru it in which the
figure drinks when the child drinks which I showed to Ed Baggott ~~ has 6 to 8 m
just ~~ a year ago and which BF Michtom likes, has just appeared on the market
(Jamison Plastics Corp, Freeport, N.Y.) Baggott turned this one down himself.
Baggott has shown bad faith in that a suggestion of mine last January regarding
a doll heartbeat mechanism which (a) requires no winding and (or) (b) requires
no mechanical motor - he expressed considerable interest in ~~ forgot about ~~
supposedly forgot about and, in his

### Page 48
Oct 28 - 51 own words, is now developing without my knowledge prior to this. In
addition, Baggott has been stalling me off regarding the acceptance of a toy
thermometer and doll {{strikethrough}}drawing{{strikethrough}} re pp.50, 54, 70)
which I gave him drawings of on back in June 21. He (Baggott) claims that Mr.
Mersky (comptroller of ideal) has seen and lies this item and that Mr. Lionel
Weintraub, also of ideal) hasn't seen it as yet but will be shown it shortly.
This stalling has been going on now for over two months and I will shortly
demand some action. One more reflection regarding Baggott On August 2nd (p53) I
showed him a drawing (recorded by mail) of a toy doll or figure with a moving
mouth. He seemed quite interested at first and then later on merely remarked
when I mentioned this item that "dolls are getting too complicated." A patent
search (my last trip to Washington) has revealed that this item is patentable. I
have just written Talking Devices Co of Chicago for information on their talking
tapes Witnessed by; H. Tomelson Nov. 22, 1951 Oct 28-51 to continue development
of this one without Baggott, it appears to me, either has a bad memory,
continally changes his mind or is approaching senility. He has not kept his
promises in regards to the cooperating in putting across the many items I
submitted to him Mr. James W. Johnson (95 Liberty St, Jovan Labs Inc Johnson was
introduced to me by Morton Friedman last Spring. of the items I discussed with
him I have mentioned: (a) Truck cargo (removable) container and (b) inflatable
packing for protecting goods in shipment together with some of the design
consideration. There is a possibility, due to the fact that Johnson has not kept
his word regarding calling me and continuing our relationship, that he (Johnson)
may be developing or patenting these items without letting me know. I am
therefore recording

Jerome Lemelson Nov 17-1951 Witnessed by: H. Lemelson Nov 22, 1951 Note: On a
previous react to Lubras of Greyshaw Inc. I suggested the the cue of mechanical
doll trying mechanism in blocks (toy plastic, hollow blocks). He thought it was
a good idea but made no offense to me. My latest conception in this time is to
offer a series of blocks, lack to represent a different animal with a different
crier or sound written, shape the face with the animal indented have the animals
mouth open and indented clean three (a hole) the blocks to simulate a mouse
making animal. This is a variation of the doll throwing mouth (p. 69) and
another variation would be to design the mechanism shown at the bottom of p. 69
with all parts flat ~~such as the ~~ with certain of the flat parts moving as
the sounding mechanism sounds off. The toy would preferably be put in a clear
plastic case such as a block or other toy so that the parts could be more
delicately moved without danger of breaking. a toy baby crying, saying ma-ma,
pa-pa, etc. could be substituted for the animals if desired. Jerome Lemelson Nov

Target Toy : Today I mailed a model to Will Fisher of the toy shown in Fig. 5 of
my patent application on magnetic target viz: a toy figure holding on to a
string at the upper end of which is a ball (baloon) with a magnet in the top of
it. A magnet above it on a frame extending from the same base which holds the
target

### Page 53
suspends the ball in space by the metalmagnetic attraction against the tension
of the line. Other variations ~~on this~~ this principle for magnetic toys are
(a) an observation baloon (ping pong ball) suspended below a clod, (b) a rocket
on the end of the string suspended below the moon, (c) A  on the end of a string
suspended in space (d) The Hindu Indian rope trick with the rope suspended in
the described manner (e) a punching bag suspended as described and a toy figure
for knocking it out of the magnetic field, (f) the target swiveled below the
magnet so that it may spin, etc. I also mailed Will Fisher a toy block
containing a crier; my idea being to put criers in each block to teach the child
these sounds (moo-for a cowwhich is pictured on block, ma-ma, pa-pa, etc) and to
amuse him See pag. 72 Jerome Lemelson Nov. 15-1951 Witnessed by: H. Lemelson,
Nov. 22, 1951 Also Nov. 15-1951 Mr. Baggott informed me today over the phone
that Ideal is not interested in the thermometer (pp. 50, 54, 70); the reason he
gave was that the stroke of the thermometer ~~is not~~ (mechanical colored rod
which pushs in when pressed against the tips of a doll) is not great enough. In
July he told me they were working on this and would put it into their doctor or
doll first aid toy kit. Baggott has been stalling me on this one and I have
caught him being on several occasions to hold up on a final decision. I am
recording this in the event that they (Ideal) should decide to put the item on
the market. I have requested Baggott to return the photostat of the drawing I
submitted to him. When I get this I will not open the envelope but will keep it
supplement these notes in the event of future litigation. Jerome Lemelson Nov.

1952 Witnessed by: H. Lemelson 2/29/52 Feb. 13, 1952 The following items were
recently conceived. Rubber or Plastisol (polyvenyl-chloride) covered materials.
A number of items have been conceived which utilize a base item covered by a
layer of plastic material such as a plastisol (polyvenyl chloride) or rubber.
Covering the item with the rubber or rubber like layer which is actually bonded
to the surface gives it unique new qualities on permits the performing of a past
function in a cheaper and more efficient manner. and perhaps permits the item to
be fabricated more cheaply. Item (1)- ~~Plo~~Polishing or Cleaning Granule A
ball granule made either of a solid lump of a rubber or rubber like material
such as a plasticol (polyvenylchlor) (over)

a polishing or cleaning agent or abrasive. Diagram of rubber like shot or

Solid medium hard rubber or plastisol or steel, lead, etc. covering of plastisol
Item: #2: Seal for solid containers (such as glass, etc) It is conceived that a
container and its cover which are made, for example of ~~faile~~fairly rigid
material, may be effectively sealed by coating the contacting surfaces with a
rubber or rubber like material such as a plastisol and possibly shaping the
surfaces for most efficient operation. If the proper machines are perfected to
apply the plastisol, self sealing glass jars which do not require rubber washers
may be bad; viz: SEAL #1

Feb. 28, 1952 The following items have been: conceived and are now first being
recorded as I am planning to work for one of the machine design companies or job
shops (engineering) and will most likely have to sign a patent agreement similar
to the one I signed for Design Service Company but which is now void as I am no
longer working for them. FORMING DIES: a die for forming thin sheet and of metal
and other formable materials has been conceived utilizing magnetic fluids or
fine particles which are frozen in shape by magnetic forces and then ~~ as ~~
utilized as male and (or) female dies to form the material. The procedure for
their fabrication would be as follows.

(A)~~form to be stamped~~shape to be formed C partition (A) partition (B)
magnetic fluid (particles) (fluid to be heated for thermo forming of plastics,
etc.) Housing ~~ The housing is placed in a magnetic field A magnetic field is
produced around the housing after the form (A) is inserted as shown with a
partition (B) surrounding the form so that the two halves of the die may be
separated when frozen by the magnetic ~~ field ~~ forces. The die halves are
then separated, a sheet of material to be formed is placed between them and they
are brought together in a press to make the resulting form. Coils of magnetic
field producing may actually run thru magnetic fluid: c for added field strength
Impact Forming: It is conceived that thin sheets may be bent or formed about a
die by causing a fluid to impinge at great dynamic pressure (as in impact)
against the sheet which is placed over a male or female form. The whole
operation would preferably ~~viz.~~ take place in a closed vessle. Witnessed by:

fits. From fig. 2 it can be seen that the compressed washer ~~ woul ~~ seals off
the space under the head after the rivet is set. Variations: The following

Conception of Invention: The following ideas regarding plastics, there
processing and treatment have been conceived. In general the ideas have been
conceived as a result of the recent announcement about the "plastigels" (re:
Modern Plastics Magazine" Jan 1952, putty-like' plastic substances which may be
formed at room temperature under low pressure and hardened at temperatures of
300° to 400°F. It is conceived by the author that a variety of new products and
applications June 4-1952 of these plastigels may be made. In particular, the use
of "electronic" heat may be utilized to fabricate these new products ~~and p~~
and a variety of new processes. At this writing , the ideas may be broken down
into the following categories. I. Plastigels ( or other plastics) combined
mechanically with other compounds for (a) new uses and effects and (b) color
combinations of plastigels to create new effects and products II. New ~~teh~~
techniques for fabricating plastics such as plastigels by radio or electronic
heat III. Fusing plastigels with ultrasonic waves. Describing in more detail: I.
Plastigels combined and processed with soft vinyl (poly vinyl chloride. A number
of new products are conceived at present from time to time I expect to add
others to the following list: (a) As a ridgitizing or reenforcing agent. (1)

June 4-1952 and adhere by fuzing with the base material. Note: For the
aforementioned applications and those to follow, a thermosetting plastic may
conceivably be utilized. However, it is the belief of the writer that the
plastigels are best suited for the application, as they are easily handled at
room temperature at low pressure. (2) Button formed on vinyl of plastigel: A

that Pilot Plastics Company of Paterson, N.J. is now manufacturing an assembly
toy having the embodyment of an invention which was conceived by me over a year
ago. According to my records I have a stamped sealed envelope dated August 30,
1951 which contains drawings and a description of my toy "Springs 'n Things"
which comprises a toy figure assembly kit having parts representing the head,
torso, feet, etc. joined by limb members which are springs giving the toy a
dynamic effect I have been working on the patent application for this for the
past four months and it is just about completed and ready to file as this is
written One reason for the delay in filing was due to the fact that ~~ I ~~
after ~~ discover ~~ building models I discovered the toy figures to be unstable
due to the fact that the leg members were flexible and, as they were made of
plastic wire springs, they were not able to form a stable figure. I solve this
in my patent application by utilizing heavy foot members or foot members which
are suction cups, an arrangement which I only conceived about five months ago.
However the figures could be assembled

with rigid leg members and highly flexible arm and neck elements. Jerome

comprises essentially a spring loaded arm 1 pivotably mounted on a base 7 having
a suction cup 4 secured to one end thereof and a holding means 5 for the object
6 to be catapulted. A suction cup 4 secured to the end of 1 is pressed against
the surface of 7 against the tension of spring 3. After a brief delay, the
spring 3 tension overcomes the suction cup holding force and the arm swings up
in the direction of the arrow A causing the ball 6 to be catapulted. Note: the
suction cup 4 may be replaced by a ~~ pie ~~ lump of tacky substance such as tar
or gum which holds down arm 1 until the tension of the spring over comes it. The

Oct. 30-1948 have been conceived by the author in connection with his work in
jet propulsion for Project Squid at New York University. These records are being
kept by the author for the following purposes. 1. As a reference aid to the
author in his future work. 2. To establish a date of conception for possible
patent application in the future in devices relating to jet engine designs. 3.
To establish proof that the author has conceived of, and, is the inventor of
these various devices. In such cases where the author has collaborated with
others on the project with such designs, or where other persons are solely
responsible for the design, the author will make mention of such in writing.

JAN. 31-1949 On this date the author conceived of a method of cooling and
preserving the grid structure. One of the experimental grids (made of 3/8" sheet
brass) melted during operation of the engine. To protect the grid, the author
suggests that fuel to be introduced in the primary and secondary region thru
this grid. This might be the point which will make the grid workable in the

April 14 – 1950 Process For Finishing Aluminum with a Lustrous or Polished
Surface: The author proposes the following process for putting a highly
reflective and polished surface on aluminum and aluminum objects. It is the
desire to such a process where aluminum is to be used as a structure and as an
ornamental surface. At the time of this writing, no method has been developed
whereby aluminum may be chrome plated. The following technique may serve the
purpose and experiments will be conducted to ascertain if it may be successfully
and satisfactorily accomplished. ~~ Ch ~~ Step I — Chroming the aluminum surface
either by the present techniques or by the development of a technique whereby
the process may be accomplished at a lower temperature (solution temperature).
Step II — Polishing the chromised surface by: (a) Mechanical buffing (b) Acid
cleaning and polishing (c) Buffing or polishing the surface by using a fine
grained polishing or buffing compound suspended in a jet of high velocity steam
or air. This

would differ from sand blasting in that the working particles would be much
finer, they would be suspended in a liquid, fluid such as steam or other gas
which would be ejected through small nozzles at a very high velocity, impinging
on the surface and polishing it. Jerome Lemelson Apr. 14, 1950

materials with x-rays, or high energy electrons to change their physical
characteristics. Ordinary polyethylene for example when irradiated changes to a
more durable plastic when irradiated with electrons in the range of several
million electron will be increased in its ability to withstand heat, improved in
durability, hardness, etc. An article (page 1, column 8 of July 18th 1956 issue
of the Wall Street Journal) mentions that Ford Motor Company can concentrate
dye~~ s ~~ change ~~ to ~~ neutral white paint, etc to colored paint by playing
a controlled radiation (electron) gun over the paint. The following are methods
of are~~ a ~~ radiating a specific part of an article, leaving the rest of the

Fig. 1 shows an article of manufacture (A) which is made of a plastic or other
material, or coated with a ~~ m ~~ paint whereby said material or coating
exhibits improved physical characteristics and (or) change of color or shade
after irradiation by high energy electrons or other atomic particles such as
those produced b a Van der Gaff generator A mask (M) is positioned between said
article (A) and a source (SR) of said radiation, said mask acting to absorb all
or part of the energy fro SR except at an opening(s) H in said Mask. The surface
of (A) opposite the opening H thus receives a greater degree of radiation than
the rest of (A.) The mask may be made of any material which will absorb the
desired degree of said radiation for a given thickness. It may be made of lead,
or any suitable metal. It may also comprise photsenstive glass or plastic having
one or more developed or etched areas thereof ~~ thru ~~ capable of absorbing
more of the radiant energy from the source SR than the other areas thereof.
Another conceived use of such a mask and process of radiation is in the
manufacture of articles of plastic having different areas of a single shape with
different physical characteristics. Jerome Lemelson 3/15/56 Witnessed NJ 7/18/56

### Page 21
As stated, ordinary polyethylene when irradiated with high energy atomic
radiation, x-rays, etc. becomes more rigid and exhibits improved physical and
chemical characteristics By using a mask of the types illustrated on p.30, a
sheet of polyethylene plastic may be produced by radiation which has an area of
thereof which is rigid and an area or areas which are flexible (not irradiation
or not as much irradiated as the other). A multitude of new products are
conceived with such a construction such as (a) plastic clothing, containers,

that the trade marked plastic Mylar a polyester resin, provided as a sheet less
than a thousandth of an inch thick or several ~~ so ~~ thousandths of an inch ~~
is ~~ thick will serve as an excellent material for 10 which will not tear or
bend easily. The ~~ materi ~~ sheet 10 may be made of transparent plastic which
has been metallized or otherwise rendered highly light reflective so that
ambient light striking the surface of the flap 11 will be reflected in different
directions as said flap moves and will provide essentially an ~~ lig ~~ area of
scintillating light to an observer who is ~~ fo ~~ viewing said ~~ sig ~~
display sheet 10 The design of the flap 11 is such that it hangs downward from a
narrow neck 11' and is joined by said neck to the sheet 10. The neck 11 is
preferably of such a dimension that the degree of ambient or surrounding

breeze used to displace the flap 10 will effect its motion without effecting
permanent deformation of said material or tearing it at said neck 11' so that
the ~~ love ~~ lower section 11" of the flap 11 will return to a pre ~~ deformed
~~ displaced position and hang by gravity when no breeze or air is present or
will swing in the other direction relative to the sheet 10 as illustrated in the
edge view Fig 2 when the direction of the ambient breeze shifts. The neck 11'
thus acts as a cantilevered spring which coacts with the weight of the lower
section 11" of the flap 11 to return the flap to its predisplaced position. ~~
Th ~~ The numeral 15 refers to a cut-out or area of the sheet 10 which has been
removed around the flap or petal 11 so that its edges will not bend and it is
free to swing. The area 15 is preferably at least several thousandths of an inch
across and extends from the neck 11' completely around 11 Several MHB 7/31/56

designs for the flap 11 are illustrated in Fig. 1 and are referred to by the
numerals 12, 13, and 14. The flap or petal 12 is rectangularly shaped; 13
triangular shaped as compared to the pear shaped petal 11. The numeral 14 refers
to a flap, rectangularly shaped, which is formed in 10 by providing a ~~ simple
~~ slit or cut 15' in ~~ 10 ~~ said sheet without providing the previously
described cut-out area 15. Such a petal design may be used as an effective
display device if (a) the area 15a where the flap 14 joins the sheet 10 is
deformed with a bend 15a^ in it so that the petal 14 normally hangs away from
the sheet 10^ in Fig. 3 or (b) if the sheet 10 is mounted so that is is oblique
with horizontal and the weight of 14 keeps said flap ~~ in ~~ at an angle to 10,
so that it will swing in the breeze without being engaged with the sheet 10 in a
manner to prevent its motion. Jerome H Lemelson July 24, 56 July 31, 1956 Fig. 2
(p.33) shows additional constructional

features of a display incorporating ~~ the ~~ one or more of the petals of Fig.
1. The plastic sheet 10 is secured on a rigid frame compressing at least two
horizontally extending beams 16, & 17 secured to the verticle beams 17^ near the
borders of said sheet by fasteners, cement, or other means It is noted that the
single frame of Fig. 2 may be replaced by a rigid lattice work made of multiple
rigid strips and with sheet 10 so secured ~~ on ~~ thereof that ~~ the ~~ each
flap or petal is free to swing as illustrated by the dotted lines of Fig. 4.
Fig. 4 may represent ~~ the lattice ~~ such a lattice mount for the sheet 10 in
crossection whereby the area 10 represents horizontal crossmembers joined to one
or more verticle crossmembers. Fig 4 may also represent another construction
whereby the numeral 18 refers to a single board against which the then plastic
sheet 10 is secured. A hole 19 is provided in 18 behind each petal 11, so that
said petal may swing freely thru said hole when a breeze impinged against the

impinging against either side of 18 while said board provides rigid support for
10 and prevents at (10) from deflecting with the wind, thus providing an
efficient display device. While the numeral 25 of Fig. 1 refers to the
metallized area of 10, the numeral 21 refers to an area adjacent to 22 which may
be a different color or not light reflecting. This may be effected by masking or
painting over the area 21. It is noted that such a construction may be used to
form a display of different colors on the viewing surface of 10 or to provide a
simple and low cost means of providing a design on 10 such as in an alphabetical
letter or numeral without the necessity of cutting said sheet to the required
shape. Of somewhat application of the display is as a base for a sign whereby a
large sheet 10 is provided Jerome Lemelson 7/31 56

with a multitude of said petals 11 cut therein and closely spaced. For a highly
scintillating effect the petals 11 are preferably less than 1/2 inch in diameter

to form a series of side by side letters or words each of which is either either
metallized or opaque depending on the effect desired. Ambient light may then be
used to show up said letters or areas 21 or a light LS (Fig. 2) may be provided
in front of the sign. The non-opaque areas 21 will then be easily discernible
from the opaque areas 21 by a slight degree of scintillation as the petals 11

or mechanical compression of the fluid. SWN – Shock wave created in a duct and
adapted to travel essentially normal to the walls of said duct along said duct

are created in rapid succession or at any specified frequencies and travel from
one part of said duct to another part or end of said duct. Jerome H Lemelson Mar

for passing a gas, liquid or flowable material into a duct or chamber in which
shock waves are created. Material to be operated on, chemically or physically
changed by said shock wave or waves. VE – An outlet valve from a duct or chamber
in which shock waves may be created or passed by, for the removal of a fluid or
flowable solid material or solid article admitted thereto to contact with or be
operated on by said shock waves. Other terms will be defined in the

Device #1

Fig. 1 In fig. 1, two shock tubes DT-1 and DT2 are placed end to end in endwise
alignment so that the shockwaves SWN-1 and SWN2 created in each will approach
each other. By timing the formation of each shock in the upstream end of its
respective tube they may be made to appear at the working zone ZN (located at
the end of each tube) at essentially the same time. The fluid in zone ZN will
thus be compressed by the action of both waves converging thereon. If the waves
SWN1 and SWN2 are created by resonating effects in each tube (i.e.- if each tube
is the exhaust end of a pulse jet, free piston engine exhaust or any type of
tuned or J.H.L. 3/21/57 M.B. Friedman 3/21/57

as a result of said resonation) and if both tubes are operating in
synchronization with each other (i.e.- the intermittent or repetitive shocks ~~
waves arrive ~~ waves arrive at ZN at the same time) then both tubes will act
essentially as closed end or quarter wave tubes as the shocks will reflect off
each other upon impact ~~ and travel ~~ or intersecting and travel back the
tubes. Valves V-1 and VE are secured to the walls of the joined tubes DT-1 and
DT-2 adjacent said working zone ZN and are adapted to respectively admit and
exhaust a fluid to said zone. The notation W-1 refers to a fluid in duct P-1
prior to entry into said zone ZN and W-2 to the fluid exhausted from zone ZN.
This fluid (i.e. the fluid entering thru valve V-1 may be the same as that
already in the shock tubes or it may be a different fluid. The fluid in JHL

are provide to inject a fluid or fluids into the working zone and remove the
resulting fluid therefrom both preferably operating to open and close at
predetermined rate or otherwise as described. In Fig. 3, the working zone ZN"
comprises a chamber of greater crossection than the duct DT into which a greater
volume of fluid may be infected at any angle and in which said fluid may collect
(if a liquid or residue) such as in the illustrated sump zone SZ. It is noted
that such a chamber may be provided in the working zone ZN of Fig. 1 between the
two shock tubes DT-1 and DT-2 In Fig. 3, the fluid infector or valve V-1 is
shown mounted so as to inject said fluid at essentially right angles to the
shock waves generated in the duct DT. Said fluid may be injected in this manner
to enhance or augment any resonating effects set up in duct DT which augment or

said shock waves will eventually form an equilateral pyramid of decreasing
volume with a center the center of the sphere. By injecting a fluid ot flowable
material thru a fifth duct P-1 towards the center of the sphere said fluid may
be caught between said four shocks and will be greatly compressed by the action
of all four shocks converging on said fluid. Multiple injection ducts or nozzles
similar to P-1 and all aimed towards the center of the sphere may be provided to
improve the efficiency of the device One or more exhaust or take off valves may

operation of said valve or valves V.E may result from applying a vacuum to the
line P2. Said exhaust line or lines P-2 may be components of a pulsating jet or

Methods of Extruding Aluminum etc July 8, 1957 The following ideas have been
conceived concerning the extrusion of metals and plastics. A patent application
will be worked on in the near future describing & claiming these ideas. 1 - Stop

thickness save at one or more plug like sections 42 ~~of~~ which close off the
interior of said tube as shown and are an integral formation of the material of
said wall 40. The solid sections 42 are formed by axial manipulation of the
mandrel utilized to extrude said tubing in the extrusion die in the manner to be
described. Said sections 42 may be provided to serve one or more of several
purposes. They may be used to strengthen or stiffen said tubing per se in or in
~~area~~ lengths thereof where greatest loads are to be exerted such as at ~~p~~
sections where other structural members are to be secured thereto and exert a
load thereon. The solid sections 42 may be provided where it is desired to drill
partially or completely thru the walls of said tubing for securing it to other
members with fasteners or the like

or where it is desired to weld, braze or solder said tubing to other members.
The solid section when machined or operated on will provide a structure much
stronger than the thinner and weaker tube wall 40. Since section 42 may be made
solid thru and thru the wall thickness of the rest of the tubing may be less
than conventional tubing used for the same purpose. Sections 42 may be provided
at equal distances along the length of the tube and serve as stiffeners for the
walls thereof or at predetermined points in the length of the tube in accordance
with the later fabrication requirements of said tube. If the tubing 15 is to be
used as a fluid conductor, or storage medium one or more sections 42 may be used
to confine the fluid to a length of the tube and may also be used as a base for
securing a fluid

drilling radially and axially in the plug section 42 or oblique to the
longitudinal axes of the tube thru to the hollow interior volume 41 as shown by
the dotted lines 44 and tapping the hole if necessary. Fig. 9 shows a section of
a tube 40a formed in the manner in which tube 40 was shaped with a plug-section
42 of greater length than 42 of Fig. 8. If the tube 40a. is cut along the plane

in one end of thereof the chamber 14 thereof and held by an end plate 13. The
expressing of a flowable material such as aluminum is effected while said
material is in a molten or semi-fluid state at ~~ heated below its molten state
or cold by conventional means. In the apparatus of Fig ~~7  1 a piston 20
travels longitudinally in the chamber 14 by the action of one or more hydraulic
cylinders 27, which is shown with

its ram 26 connected to the rear section 22 of piston 20 via two or more rods 25
and a yoke plate 24. The rods 25 travel axially in bearings in a base plate 19

urged in reciprocating motion therein, so that its far end travels in and out of
the bore in the die block 12, by the ram 18' of a second hydraulic cylinder 18

shown in Fig. 8 to the extended position of Fig. 9 against the modified, mandrel
36 whereby a slot 37 is formed in the extruding wall of the extrusion 15’ as it
~~ ex ~~ is formed. When the tapered nose 30b of the tool 30” is retracted to
the position of Fig. 8 the cylindrical tube ~~ shown ~~ section illustrated is
extruded. The numeral 35 refers to a cavity on the surface of mandrel 36 for
receiving and supporting the tip ~~ 30b of the stop-tool 30’ when the latter
projects across the die opening. This insures that the cavity 35 may not be
eliminated if the tool

tip 30b is strong enough to resist breakage during extrusion provided that the
end of 30b is shaped to the contour of the surface of mandrel 36 and it abuts
said surface when a thru slot 37 is desired. If a cavity 35 is provided it is
preferably without walls to abutt and support the end of 30b against
longitudinal (axial) displacement during extrusion and is provided ~~ preferably
in the surface of 36 at ~~ at ~~ a point near the end of 36 beyond which the
tubing has already formed so that extruding material will not flow into said
cavity but will flow over following the outer surface of the mandrel. Jerome

Sept. 1, 1957 Additional Material to Be Added to the specification of the
invention of pp. 16–77 p. 71 to end of page add (A) Also shown in Fig. 71 is a
marking device 39 secured to the frame 2 of the press and positioned adjacent
the extruding tube 15 for providing a mark on the exterior of said tube which is
indicative of the variations in internal crossection. For example, if a solid
plug-like member section 42 is formed at a particular length or section of the
extrusion said section may not be easily discernable from the exterior of the
tube by visual means and tube is not made of a translutransparent material. It
may therefore be desirable to mark the section of the tube where the section 42
occurs in the event it is desireed to drill thru or cut into the section 42. The
marker 39 may be any well known marking device which is solonoid operated and
may comprise simply a solonoid stamp for putting an indented mark in the
exterior wall of 15 as it moves past. (A)

are controlled by automatic sequencing means to be described. It is noted that
two or more stop-extrusion tools may be provided side by side to produce when
acting c together, either a series of spaced apart or side-by-side holes in any
particular face of the extrusion or to produce d a single hole of width which
varies according to the number of tools covering the die opening. The latter
condition requires that the tools all be have parallel side-walls which alert

Sept. 25-1957 I visited American Art Works at their Coshocton, Ohio Plant today
and discussed technical aspects of my Display Device (applications 260,954 & SN,
616,089) with their management personnel including Mssrs. M.P. Murphy, Bob Huey,
Bob Cantor, a Mr. King and their art director. They claim they would like to
work on a commercial model before a final decision regarding ~~ use ~~ licensing
it from me can be made. I suggested the following: (1) Border sealing of the
plastic lens ~~ e ~~ sheet to the base sheet to hermetically seal the interface
against moisture & weathering by (a) A plastic coating over the border openings
(b) Heat or electronic sealing means (c) Compression of the plastic sheet
between a folded border of the sheet metal base combined if necessary with (a).
I also suggested that a relatively low index of refraction cement or

plastic be used for bonding the scotch lite to the lens sheet (i.e. - an alkyd
resin or the like) I also gave them ideas concerning the manufacture of large
signs such as by latching a number of square or rectangular segments made
separately together or by light (movement) scanning means or intermittent
exposure of different areas to create the silk screen master. Further
suggestions were made relating to the material already submitted to them. Jerome

### Page 53
me that a decision would be forthcoming from Mr. Wilbening in a few days after
he sees the model. Jerome H. Lemelson Feb. 22, 1958 March 2, 1958 I visited Mr.
Nick Argiro at his home at 780 Riverside Drive, N.Y.C. Apt 10F today. He showed
me a number of new toys he had just licensed to Holgate Toys which will be
displayed at the Toy Fair in a week including six new items (a skiperaper
consisting of flat slate with an array of holes held apart by ~~ tu ~~ short
tubes of wood in a simple wooden rod secured to a base, slats to be made of rib
reenforces plastic sheets instead of masonite as originally designed; a wooden

Suburban Toy Company of Pittsburgh, Pa who had accepted two of his toy designs
JL March 2, 1958 Lenore Waldmeyer March3, 1958

a rubber bulb activated baseball pitcher and a swatting baseball on a string. It
seems that Nicks present partner Ernest Swimmer knows an associate (described as
the general foreman) of Novelty Manufacturing Company, Newark, N.J. I disclosed
ideas for my delayed action movement toys (patent pending) ~~ and n ~~ including
the patent drawing, several other drawings and a model of the delayed action
ball pitching game. Sal Berger signed an agreement with me last summer before
seeing the item, and the drawings, not to disclose it to anyone and to keep the
idea confidential. Apparently his foreman or one of his associates told and
described the idea to Ernest Swimmer. According to Argero, Swimmer told Suburban
Toys president about the item and Argero believes Suburban may make it. Argero
offered Jerome Lemelson Mar. 2, 1950 LW 3/3/58

### Page 54
to take my model to Suburban Toy but I informed him that it is presented under
consideration by Wilkening I also informed Argero that I have other designs for
the catapult including a rocket launching platform, target game, Jack in the
box, etc. Argero informed me that he had just developed a rocket launcher to
sell for about 3.00 retail to Kohner Brothers. He also informed me that his
present partner, with whom he is negotiating a split in their partnership, told
the president about the delayed action catapult, as stated, and while it is not
stated for production this year there is a possibility it may be produced next
year. If this happens, Argero plans to attempt to have Suburban pay him under
the agreement they have with him for his baseball pitcher. All this appears to
be quite confusing to the writers who recalls that Sol Berger proprietor of
Novelty Manufacturing Company J.L. March 2, 1958 LW 3/3/58

mentioned he knew the fellows who developed a baseball pitching game when I
showed him my baseball pitcher last summer and I recall informing him (Berger)
that under no circumstance must they be informed of my invention. He agreed and
signed the agreement. I intend to discuss this matter with attorney, Jerry

species therein may be marketable such as the pin-ball components, printed
circuit structure, etc. (2.) March 5, 1958 I intend to work on the following toy
inventions as soon as I get time. (1.) Floating target game. This game is based
on the Bernouli effect of floating a light ball in an airstream, viz.

The balls A and A' which may be ping pong or styrofoam balls less than 1" in
diameter are floated on streams of air ejected from tubes B and B' which are
connected to the hollow sphere C. The sphere C may be pressurized by means of a
balloon (D) or by a pump P feeding air thru a line L. and then thru base D into
C. A rotary seal in accordance with my (Fig. 5 patent # 2654973 may be provided
between C and D and the assembly which includes C, B and

Art Lerner AM 3-25-58 MBF 7/15/58

B' may be rotated on (D) by air pressure, air being ejected in a plane
perpendicular to the axis of rotation by means of holes near the ends of B and
B' also in accordance with my patent 2654973. An electric motor may be used to
drive the pump P as well as rotate C ~~ and ~~ on D.

This is a verticle crossection of such a toy object is to shoot balls A, A' out
of supporting streams with a pellet. Jerome H Lemelson March 5-1958 Also
conceived on March 5-58 are the following designs for target games utilizing the
Bernouli effect (over) MBF 7/15/58 AM 3-25-58

bearings 18, 18' ad has a flat spur gear 20 secured to its bottom surface. The
flat spur 20 is engaged by a small circular spur gear 22 driven by a motor 24
also secured to frame 10'. Thus rotation of 22 by motor 24 will cause the tube
16 to travel longitudinally in bearings 18, 18'. The motor 24 may be an
automatic reversing motor or ~~ an automatic reversing spur gear drive with air
shaft input which turning in one direction by the motor may be employed one or

- 1958 I have had a number of meetings with Nick Argiro in the past four weeks
and yesterday presented him with an agreement pertaining to his work on models
of ideas and inventions I would submit whereby we would share in any royalties
received on the developed

product. Also discussed with Argiro while at the Toy Fair, ~~ and ~~ last week
and yesterday were the following ideas. (1) Some variations in my delay Action
Release Toys (re: pp. 94 to 97 of this book) which Nick is quite anxious to
handle He desires to show one or more of these ideas to Hassenfeld Brothers yet
hasn't mentioned the ball pitcher to Mr. Faloon of Suburban Toy Company. Also
mentioned and described to Argiro where my ideas for employing the delay action

of variations on my Delayed Action Release Toys and a model. He agreed
beforehand to sign my standard agreement and the drawings, but he signed the
agreement but refused to sign any of the drawings after seeing them staling that
he debut want to get involved in the future in a law suit if he should like any
of the ideas without my delayed action suction cups mechanisms. I feel there is
considerable novelty in the baseball pitcher, batter, football player, bowler,
basketball player, and the others outside of the release mechanism. Jerome H

26-1958 The air operated target apparatus of pages 98 to 102 was described to

107 Met Arguro at the Toy Fair. When he mentioned the he had seen Kusan's
satellite train I told him that I had received a patent for a jet propelled for
a toy cap (2,654,973 patent) which could be applied to such a principle and that
I had recorded a design for such a target game just a few weeks prior to the Toy
Fair in my notebook. He agreed that it would be a good thing to work on and I
intend to work-up some detailed design sketches of the toys very shortly. Jerome
Lemelson March 26, 58 I read and understood the material at the bottom of the
page 106 and above of this notebook on the 26th of March 1958. Lenore Waldmeyer

### Page 59

would, if he chooses, produce models of the designs. He has failed to sign the
agreement and has not called me. I therefore see fit to record a few more ideas
I disclosed to him in the past few weeks when I had hoped we would work out
together in the future. (1) Ball Manipulation Same ref. p103 I showed him a
model of the game in my pending application and mentioned that it should be
provided as part of a cereal box with the foamed plastic ball inside. I also
mentioned that the embodiment of my application could be made of vacuum ed
formed plastic sheet. (2) Magnetic Target Game- I left my model of this game
with him (at his home several weeks ago) and mentioned that the target could be
made to rotated by rotating the suspending magnet or Nov 31, 58 LW B 4/2/58

to oscillate by moving the suspending magnet or using an electromagnet with a
varying voltage within its coil. I also mentioned that this could be used as a
satellite toy. Jerome Also mentioned for a variation in the Ball Manipulation
game was the use of a totally enclosed vacuum formed surface under a transparent
plastic sheet. Jerry Lemelson March 31, 1958 I also mentioned to Nick that I
have an application pending which includes a constructional toy having foamed
plastic slabs joined by elongated pins to form the floors and roof of a building
and/or walls of a building. Jerry Lemelson March 31, 1958 Mar 31,58 LW. April
1-58 farther recall that in conversing JB 4/2/58

### Page 60
about the Ball Manipulation Game with Nick Argus I mentioned that I had
conceived of possible names for the game such as Huff-n-Puff Baseball, Football,
Basketball, etc. I also mentioned that the vacuum formed construction using a
playing surface formed of sheet plastic with a sense of indentations, ridges, ~~
etc ~~ holes, etc for manipulating or rolling a ball across could be used with a
marble or other ball in a variety of different types of games, the construction
being singular to that shown in my pending application entitled Ball
Manipulation. Some with the upper surface of the sheet shared with said
irregularities, hollows or holes. Jerome Lemelson April 1, 1958 Record of
Conception of Invention. The following designs for the construction of bubbling
Christmas tree lights are conceived to simplify the method of JB 4/2/58

14 is an elongated glass tube ~~ 20 ~~ 22 having a cylindrical wall ~~ 22 ~~,
which is closed at the top 22' and separated from the volume of the bulbous
bottom section 12 by a ~~ the ~~ partition 23. Disposed in the bottom of 20 and
preferably adhered to the upper surface of 23 is a small quantity of porous
matter 24 for the formulation of bubbles in the liquid L ~~ 26 pa ~~ which
partially fills the entire volume 26 of tube 20 under reduced pressure. The
liquid ~~ 26 ~~ L may be ~~ any ~~ such refrigerants as methyl chloride,
chloroform, methylene chloride, Freon, or the like. A pale and non toxic liquide
is Freon 113,

Chlorobromomethane is hereby proposed as a new liquid for bubble tubes which
will satisfactorily suit the purpose for generating bubbles therein but is also
a good fire extinguishing agent the vapor of which will easily smother any fire
in the vicinity of the tube when released therefrom

When the bulb is lighted as current flows thru filament 17 heat is radiated
therefrom to the partition 23 and conducted therethru to the mass 24 ~~ and ~~
said heat causes liquid ~~ ending ~~ filling the pores or crevases ~~ therein to
~~ in 24 to boil and vaporize. Pockets of vapor form which, when they grow large
JB 4/2/58

enough escape as ~~ pockets or ~~ bubbles B from the mass 24. The one piece
construction of Fig. 1. has numerous advantages over conventional bubble tubes
employing a light bulb and a separate bubble tube positioned with its bottom
close to or against the upper face of the ~~ b ~~ light bulb and held by means
of a shell or coupling member which ~~ hides can~~ engages the base of the light
bulb and the base of the tube. Quite often this two piece construction results
in an assembly in which the bottom of the bubble tube does not make contact with
the upper surface of the light bulb ~~ and the ~~ with the result that not
enough heat will be ~~ tran ~~ conducted to the bottom of the bubble tube and
the latter will fail to generate bubble when the light is on. The construction
of Fig. 1 eliminates the necessity of using a securing means such JB 4/2/58

### Page 62
As the mentioned, coupling member and the tube 20 is always securely mounted and
always adapted to receive ~~ light he ~~ heat from the light bulb filament with
a high degree of efficiency of heat transfer. The wattage required of lamp 12
may therefore be lower than ~~ used in conventional bubble tubes ~~ the wattage
required for operating a conventional ~~ two ~~ assembled bubble tube device.
Since it may not be desired to have the entire light from the bulb section 12 to
directly shine into the eyes of the observer, all or part of the inner or outer
surface of bulb 14 may be coated with our opaque or translucent plastic or other
masking material, ~~ 14 ~~. The ~~ notation 14" refers to to said coating which
may extend over the surface of 14 in all but small areas thereof to give the

said liquid to boil and vaporize creating a vapor pocket which forms a bubble
which travels up tube 22. The need for providing a porous mass for generating
bubbles is thus eliminated. After the bubble has formed and travels up the tube,
liquid from above will flow into the restricted volume of ~~ 22 b’ ~~ 27 and
will remain there until heated once more so that it vaporizes. S In Fig. ~~ 3‘

less. If the restricted ~~ ? ~~ volume 29 ~~ 22 b’ ~~ is sheet0like in shape, a
still greater area of liquid in 26 will be heated from two sides to a degree
where it vaporizes and forms bubbles. In Fig. 5 the bubble tube section 22
tapers downward and outward as shown and smoothly conforms with the

end ~~ 14a ~~ 32’ of the glass lamp 12'. The light bulb section 12' is formed at
its upper end with an upwardly projecting conical wall ~~ 14b’ ~~ 3' which forms
a partition between the upper enclosed volume 26 and the volume 12C within the
light bulb section 12. Thus part of the light generated in 12C when 17 glows to
incandescence, will pass thru the ~~ volu volum ~~ conical volume 26c' at the
lower end of volume 26 and if the liquid in 26 is in motion, a shimmering effect
to the eye will be produced by refraction. If bubbles are generated in 26c they
will produce scintillating areas of light reflection as they move up the tube.
Bubbles may be produced in volume 26C' either by tapering or restricting the
lower end ~~ 26b thereof ~~ of 26 to where compresses at the lower end a volume

April 11-19 1958 Record of Conception of Invention I. Designs for and methods
and making molds and molding apparatuses. S In the art of molding hollow bodies
out of liquid plastic materials such as vinyl plastisols and organisols, said
bodies are usually make by what is known as slush or rotational molding. ~~
wherein ~~ In these techniques, a measured quantity of liquid plastic is poured
into a closed mold thru an opening therein and the mold is rotated in one or
more directions as it passes thru a furnace. The walls of the mold become hot
while in the furnace and the plastic which contacts the entire surface thereof
as the mold rotates, cures to the shape of the exterior of the mold. After a
predetermined time ~~ when ~~ the mold emerges from the furnace and the excess
plastic, if any, is poured off. If no excess plastic is present, the hollow body
is ~~ may be ~~ pulled from the mold thereafter. The use of a furnace for
heating the mold has certain

### Page 5
disadvantages and shortcomings. In addition to the waste of a considerable
amount of heat not  a radiated to the molds, heat is lost where the molds enter
and leave the furnace. Furthermore a complex conveying system must be provided
for moving the molds into and out of the furnace which is costly and difficult
to maintain. Accordingly, it is a primary object of this invention to provide
new and improved apparatus for molding hollow bodies of liquid, heat cured
plastic. Another important object is to provide improved apparatus for molding
hollow bodies  of  from liquid heat cured plastic which  o  requires a minimum
expenditure of heat to form said bodies without the need for a large furnace and
conveying system. ST Other objects and advantages of this invention will become
apparent from the following specifications and claims which relate to the
drawings where: Fig. 1 is a

A Meyerhoff 4/22/58 Fig. 1 S The apparatus of Fig. 1 comprises a two piece mold
10 consisting of mold half sections 10-a and 10-b which, when assembled as
shown, provide an internal cavity accessible from the outside thru a gate
opening 10c having a plug 10d for closing off said opening. The mold 10 is shown
held in clamping engagement between two shafts 11 and 12 each provided with a
flanged end fixture 11 and

### Page 6
12' not shown which are respectively secured by welding or fasteners to
~~their~~ said respective mold ~~half~~ halves. The shaft 11 is ~~secured~~
supported in bearing by the journals of  a  a motor and drive unit 13 and shaft
12 is supported by a pillow block 14. The base 14' of pillow block 14 is movably
mounted on a base 16 so that shaft 12 and the mold half 10-a supported thereby
may be moved axially to separate said mold half from the other mold half 10b.
Thus by with = drawing 14, the mold sections may be separated and a shaped
article ~~ Molding ~~ therein may be removed therefrom. If a heat cured,
thermoplastic material is to be slush molded to the shape of the cavity formed
by the assembly of the molds, the entire surface of the cavity wall must be
heated to cure the plastic. While a flame ~~ or heat ~~ may be directed against
the exterior of each mold and the resulting heat conducted therethru to the
cavity as the mold rotates to distribute the liquid plastic ~~ poured into ~~
provided therein, I prefer to provide electrical heating means as an integral
part of each mold half or removably associated therewith, thereby eliminating
THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER WITNESSED & UNDERSTOOD BY:  JB aam DATE

the need to dissipate a lot of heat which is wasted ~~ on ~~ by applying heat
directly to the area to be heated and reducing the time required to heat the
mold. The electrical heating means may comprise in addition to means for
conducting electrical energy to the molds halves as they rotate, one or more
heating elements secured as an integral formation ~~ to ~~ on the interior
surface of the cavity of the mold or in sandwich construction as part of the
mold wall. The numerals 17 ~~ 18 and 19 ~~ refers to conducting leads as part of
a circuit containing the electrical ~~ heating ~~ resistence heating elements
associated with the mold half 10b. Said leads or wires 17 ~~ 18 and 19 ~~ extend
from respective points on the mold half where they connect to said mold heating
element/not shown as a wire 19 shown along the shaft 11 to a respective
commutator ring 20 ~~ and 21 at least one of ~~ which are is insulated from said

TO BE CONTINUED TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN On this date, April 21st, 1958 I visited
the plant of Kohner Brothers, 155 Wooster Street N.Y.C. to discuss my delayed
action movement toys drawings of which I had mailed them on April 10-1958. They
claimed that they desire to produce and market one or more of the toy ideas I
submitted. I mentioned when they inquired about rights to all the designs for my
delayed action toys, that S.S. Adams of Asbury Park, N.J. is considering a
delayed action noisemaking toy employing a bellows, bell, or JL 4/21/58

### Page 12
percussion cap and informed them that if Adams takes these items, they would not
be part of the deal. They appeared to be interested in producing my baseball
pitcher and possibly in the rocket launcher hand game and the Jack in the Box
mailed on April 10. 1958. I left a model of the baseball pitcher catapult
employing a suction cup and a toy jumping frog. They will discuss this matter
with a patent attorney to see that a patent of a Mr. Kelly does not come in the
realm of my toys. They may approach Al Zalkind for an opinion. Jerome H Lemelson
April 21-58 J Berliner 4/21/58 April 21 - 1958 S In Fig. 4 is shown
constructional details of molding apparatus applicable to the apparatus of Figs.
1 to 3 or the like. A two-piece mold ~~ 100 ~~ is shown having a cup-like body
100 made of metal, ceramic or other suitable material with an opening at the AAM

top which may be closed off ~~ by means ~~ confining the interior volume 103 by
means of a lid or top 104 which is pivotally mounted on a hinge 108 secured to
the ~~ a rear or ~~ side-wall 101' of the lower container. ~~ 100 ~~ Shafts 11
and 12 are shown secured to respective sides 101 and 101' of the container 100
for the rotation or rocking movement thereof as described. Alan A. Meyerhoff
4/22/58 The top 104 is shaped with a downwardly projecting plug portion 104'
adapted to project into the open end thereof for effecting a seal which may be
enhanced by means of an O-ring 109 seated in a groove therein and circumscribing
the upper rim of the mold body 200. The numeral 110 refers to a handle for
lifting the top to remove the molding therefrom and a conventional latch (not
shown) or locking means may be provided to hold the top 104 in place while the
mold is being rocked or rotated. The crossectional view shows the heating
element, which is an electrical resistance element such as a layer of metal
which is embedded in an

### Page 13
insulating material, extending as a flat strip 111 in one or more circuits
around the interior of the container. The

### Page 14
resistance heating element 111 may comprise a rolled or sprayed on strip of
aluminum, ~~ or ~~ copper or other metal or alloy such as Nichrome and is shown
in Figs. 5 and 6 as being applied to a first insulating layer 112 which may
comprise a glass or ceramic material such as a porcelain glaze material,
glass-ceramic or the like applied in an integral bond to the entire interior
surface of 100 including the upper surface of the rim of said mold. The metallic
resistance element 111 may be provided in the zig-zag or looped pattern shown
which extends across the inside surface of the bottom 102 of the mold and up the
walls thereof which are not shown ~~ to ~~ in ~~ at ~~ one ~~ one ~~ or more ~~
closed ~~ continuous circuits which terminate near the outer edge of the ~~ rim

thereto which extend as shown in Fig. 4 along the outer surface of the mold and
along the adjacent shaft to a contactor ring (not shown) in accordance with the
teaching of Figs. 1 to 3. After the ceramic or porcelain layer 112 has been
applied ~~ to ~~ on, and integrally bonded to the surface of the cavity in the
mold section 100, the element 111 INSERT NOTE A ON P. 23 ~~ NOTE A SEE PAGE 23

may be applied thereto as a formed strip of metal with a high temperature cement
such as Corning glass works Pyroceram cement which may be temperature cured for
a period of an hour or so by passing electrical energy thru said resestence
element 111 for the necessary period of time. Pyroceram band Cement, No. 95,
applied to the near surface of a strip of metal in the looped shape shown for
111 will fire at between 400 to 450°C and if the temperature is maintained by
means of generating heat in said strip 111 by passing current therethru an
excellent bond will be attained A groove, the contour of the illustrated heating
element may be provided in the interior & surface of 100 so that said heating
element will not project beyond the plane of the surface and said surface will
be smooth. A second ~~ technique ~~ method of providing the electrical
resistence element 111 is to sand blast the surface on which it is to be bonded
so as to roughen it, and apply said element as a layer of metal sprayed thereon
from a molten state thru a mask having a cutout to the contour shown. The
notation 104.c in Fig. 4 refers to a cavity or indentation in the undersurface
of the lid 104 which is provided to permit an electrical

connector 114 such as a ~~ lug ~~ lug at the end of wire 19' to be secured to an
end of the resistence element 111 ~~ to be secured to said ~~ for conducting
electrical energy thereto. The cut-out or cavity 104-C ~~ ~~ in 104 will not be
necessitated if the element ~~ 103 ~~ 111 is extended beyond the surface of 104
which engages surface 101' or if the resistence element is brought over the edge
of the rim to the exterior surface of 100 or into a cavity provided in ~~ 10
surface 101' and extending to the outer edge thereof. Two methods of
electrically connecting wire 19' to the element 111 are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.
In Fig. 4, the lid 104 is notched at 104-d near an edge thereof exposing a
portion of the surface of the layer 100-S containing the conducting element 111.

cavity 103 including the fused-on ~~ strip ~~ conducting heating element 111,
said surface is smooth and free of irregularities such as projecting ridges
which may be caused for example by the strip element 111. This may be
accomplished by securing strip 111 in a recess of similar contour and provided

threaded and two nuts 114.c and 114.d hold 114.b thereon. The notation ~~ 19's
~~ 19.S of Fig. 5 refers to a hold-down fastener for securing  19' against the
outer surface of mold 100 to prevent its motion when the latter is rotated. In
Fig. 6 the conducting element 111 is bonded to the inside surface of a sheet of
~~ material 115 which comprises a sheet of metal 115a ~~ having ~~ its outer
surface adapted for surface engagement with the interior surface of the mold 100

with a ceramic, electrical insulating material as described which as thereon as
described with heat and the heating element 111 is applied by spraying plating
or as a thin strip of metal after which the entire interior surface is again
coated with a ceramic material which is fused by heat. So as not to change the
interior contour of 115, it may also be formed by casting electroplating ~~ or

absorbent material such as ~~flexible ~~ foamed plaster in a flexible condition.
The patch 18 may be secured to 12 with and adhesive or, if made of a porous
foamed plastic such as flexible vinyl foam may electronically sealed to 12. The
end portions of 12 are coated with and adhesive of the pressure sensitive
variety and pealable ~~ and ~~ covered strips 18 may be employed to cover said
adhesive prior to its use in accordance with conventional practice. A flanged
U-shaped cover 20 is secured to strip 12 in alignment with the wad 18 on the
opposite surface 13 of 12 and may be used to serve several purposes. The cover
20 may consist of a top portion 22 having side walls 24 and 24' at each end
thereof which extend to respective flange portions 26 and 26' which are secured
to the upper surface 13 of 12. The ~~ top portion ~~ cover 20 is preferably made

preferably made of a material such as rigid vinyl cellulose acetate, polystyrene
or the like which has been molded or vacuum formed to the desired U or cup
shape. If both 20 and 12 are made of polyvinyl chloride or any plastic which is
electronically heat sealable, the flanges 26 and 26' may be electronically
welded to the flexible base sheet 12 along welding lines such as 27 shown
extending along the length of said flanges which is essentally the width of the
strip 12. Otherwise, the flanges 26 and 26' may be secured to the upper surface
of 12 with and adhesive or heat sealed along lines 27 therets by means of heated

Sept. 4, 1958 Record of Conception of Inventions The following variations of the
Hula-Hoops which are sweeping the country are conceived: Ball dispensing hoops:
It is conceived to use the interior of the tubing comprising the hoop as a
storage volume for a plurality of small balls such as marbles, candy or ball gum
and to provide means for easily dispensing these balls thru an opening in the
wall of the hoop. This would serve several purposes (a) Multiple functions(1) If
the hoop is produced of transparent plastic, the balls may be seen from the
exterior as they roll around when the hoop is whirled thereby increasing the
visual attractiveness (2) means for storing and dispensing marbles and candy (3)
when filled will balls or marbles the hoop will be more difficult to twirl and
maintain on the body or arm than when empty The degree of skill required may
thus be varied by adding or removing marbles.

desired to operate the television camera 22 for a short period of time to
monitor the environment at station N. For example, if the detector 12 indicates
an abnormal or predetermined condition in the environment at station N and coded

operator at the monitor station may decide to visually monitor the environment
of the detection station 9N. He may then energize a ~~ 1 ~~ code generator 36N
by means of a switch 35. The output of the code generator 36N is connected to a
short wave transmitter 38 which transmits signals to ~~ all ~~ receivers located
at each of the detection stations. The receiver 26 of detection station 9N
receives the pulse, code from 38, and passes it to the input of a coded relay

expenditure as compared to that required for the transmission of the video
signal generated by camera 22. Since it is

### Page 52
is deenergized and/or the operator of the monitor station has not actuated his
control means therefor, so that the battery 10 will not be unessessarily
drained. A gate 23 is therefor provided between the output 10c of the battery 10
and the power input to the signal transmitter 14T for effecting said connection
only where necessary to transmit signals from the detection station. The switch
23 may be provided in a number of different forms which are adapted to complete
a circuit between 10 and 14T when the detector relay 12 is energized and/or when
the coded relay 28 is energized. The switch 23 may be a normallyopen,
slow-to-close after opening switch adapted to remain closed for a sufficient
period of time after its input is energized by a pulse signal from coded relay
28 to permit the transmission of at least one video picture signal from the
camera 22 which may be a conventional or slow scanning device. The continuous
transmission of the pulse code from code generator 36N may thus be used to
maintain 23 closed for desired periods of time

for prolonged transmission of video signals during monitoring. In addition to
the connection of the signal output of the coded relay to the switching input of
23, the output of detector 12 is also connected to said switching input so that
if either become energized, 23 will close. The receiver 26 and coded relay 28
will necessarily be connected to a source of electrical energy at all times.
They may either receive power from 10 or from their own solar batteries. If 26
and 28 ~~and ~~are made of semi-conductor switching and amplifying means, the
power drain thereof will be minimized. A further modification to the apparatus
at the detection unit is ~~ sow ~~shown in Fig. 1. The transmitter~~ por ~~ part
of 14 is preferably normally off, so as not to drain the battery. It is
connectable to the battery 10 by means of a normally open switch 13 which is

detector 12 which is generated only when the transducer thereof is energized. If

Subject: Target Games and toys using zipperless closure material Description: My
wife recently purchase a belt which utilizes a zipperless closure material which
consists of two materials one of which consists of a plurality of tiny plastic
filament hooks arranged to provide a hooking surface and a second material
having plurality of plastic filament loops in a surface which, when brought
against the hooking surface, is snared by the hooks and holds until stripped
away. These materials are being used ~~ fr ~~ to replace zippers on jackets,
etc. I conceive of using these materials in a unique dart game with one of the
materials being provided on the nose of a dart, puck, horseshoe, arrow, toy
bomb, tip of a sword or the like and the other on the surface of a target. When
the missile sword strikes the target the hooking material will engage the target
material and will hold the missile thereon or the sword may be used to move or
remove the other material from the target. A ball or sphere may also be covered
with this material and be thrown, rolled, or shot at a target form a gun or blow
pipe struck by a bat, golf club,  at a target containing the material adapted to
hook therewith Jereome Lemelson 2/14/59 Jan 14, 1959 MBF

January 21, 1959 I visited Leon Kaye, Kaye Plastics today and showed him models
of Swing-A-Ring and Glide Rocket toys I have developed. While there, Kaye showed
me a sample of a plastic part (rabbit face) he had molded, which when held
against a fluorescent light, glowed quite brightly when the light was turned
off. He said the plastic contained phosphoresent pigments. I conceived, while
present at Kaye's plant several novelty ideas including a molded skull lapel
novelty, lapel nameplates and buttons and disclosed these to him. He, however,
refused to give me samples of the material when I told him I wanted to show them
to my mold makers, (Sands and Warmbrand) who have expressed interest in the past
in making a mold for me on a royalty basis. He said that he would give me a
sample in a couple of weeks. Just before the item is introduced I have conceived
of many novel applications of this material in displays, novelties and toys
which JHL Jan 21, 1959

I expect to make the subject of pending patent application. Some of these are:
1. Articles made of flexible plastic sheeting which has been made of plastic
mixed with phosphorescent or luminescent plastic thruout. (a)Display device:
flexible "glo-sheet" used as a closed loop belt part of which is exposed to an
observer thru an opening in the display housing. The belt is driven in a closed
loop path around pulleys by a servo-motor and is exposed intermittently to light
within the housing. The light exposing the sheet-belt is presented in a pattern
so that ~~ th ~~ when the sheet is driven past the opening in the housing, the
observer will view the glowing pattern. The speed of the belt or the time
between separate exposures may be determined by the decay characteristics of the
phosphorescent material in the plastic and the effect desired. If the pattern is
always the same, such as letters and words of a message created on the belt by
stopping it in front of a mask behind which JHL Jan 21, 1959 2/14/59 MBF

June 20 - 1959 Conception Of Invention Combined circular saw blade and sander
For many mfg operations particularly those involved in cutting small wood parts,
the cut is generally rough and leaves sharp or jagged edges. It is conceived to
perform two operations with a saw blade, that of cutting plus that of finishing
during the same path. Fig 1 The blade 10 is provided with teeth 14 shaped from
the ~~ sh ~~ circle shee 12. Inward of the teeth ~~ are ~~ is provided an
abrasive surface which may be:

(a) formed from the material of 12 (b) comprise abrasive particles bonded to 12

mailed flat (die cut.) He suggested I work up models. (b) Compressed sponge- Max
asked me to develop a process for making sponge(foamed cellulose acetate,
urethane or vinyl) into a sheet flatter than normal size. I suggested use of a
paste or water soluble plastic (such as polyvinyl alcohol) impregnating normal
sponge and allowed to harden or dry while sponge is in compressed state. He
asked me to experiment on this. I also suggested that this be done with molded
figures of foamed plastic (flexible) which will "pop-up" to normal state in

number of parts which I will disclose to Max Silverman next week for proposal to
Doerty, Cliff Sears & Senseld for ~~ use ~~ giveaway with Viatlis (see next
page) The simplified ~~ dallo ~~ flash light 10 consist of only 3 molded plastic
parts, a cylindrical (or other shaped) battery holder 12, a head 16 and a
transparent plastic lens. 23. J.B. Gilstein 12/20/59

The end of 12 is threaded at 13 to receive the threaded end of 19 of lamp head
16.

Fig. 1 Transparent, flexible plastic such as plasticized vinyl

The lines in red refer to a length of metal rod, preferably music wire which
contacts the bottom of battery #2, runs along the wall of 12 and is bent into a
V-shape at the other end where it contacts the side wall of the light bulb stem
thru an opening 12/ in 20' when 20 is rotated at the proper angle pages 124
through 139 Read & understood by me on this 5th day of Dec. 1959 Jerome M.

Record of Conception of Invention Oct 29-1958 Automatic Information Storage and
Reproduction System Reference is made to the commercially available COPYFLO
continuous printer manufactured by Haloid Xerox, Inc Rochester 3, N.Y. It is
conceived to utilize a machine such as the COPYFLO 24 on the like with certain
patentable modifications in the control thereof as a major component in an
automatic storage and printing system applicable to such functions as: (a) The
system utilized by the U.S. Patent Office for the filing of copies of patents
and the retrieval of said copies for individuals requesting them. Presently a
certain number of each copy is printed and stored. Copies are hand picked by one
or more of about two dozen office workers, collected and placed in envelopes

### Page 4
which are mailed When copies run out of a particular patent, a new batch must be
printed My system would print copies only when needed, ~~ colla ~~ automatically
collate, staple or bind, collect and place them in envelopes as well as address
the envelopes and record the transaction. It is possible that the above
functions may be performed by a single operator. (b) Any system (Government or
private) where a considerable amount of information is stored and individual
pages, or groups of pages are frequently requested such as a library of
technical information, a government agency ~~ requesting ~~ from which
subscribers request bulletins, etc. Reference is made to the Schematic diagram
of the Copyflow 24 Continuous Printer on the page. The current invention
consists of modifications to the input thereto as well as the

conveying and handling of prints made in said apparatus Start The current
invention is illustrated broadly in the schematic - block diagram of Fig. 1 (on
page 7.) A single operator is required to effect the multiple functions of
selecting pictorial information to be reproduced as a plurality of pages,
collated,

First describe what happens, (operator continuously selects cards but selection
time for each card varies)

### Page 5
stapled or bound, enveloped and addressed. A plurality of image frames of the
information to be reproduced are provided in a storage system 20 which includes
means, controlled by a selector inpat for selectively drawing therefrom selected
of said frames. The frames are preferably provided as microfilmed images mounted
on punch cards ~~ for ~~ containing cutouts for identifying, selecting and
storing said cards. In a preferred form of the invention, each card is further
modified with a magnetic recording strip portion or the like for temporarily
storing thereon coded information adapted to effect one or more functions to be
described. The input for effecting the selection of predetermined cards from
system 20 may be derived by conventional selection means with modifications
thereto for recording further information on said magnetic recording area of
each card. Since the time required for the actual derivation of a particular
card or cards from the system will be

Fig. 1 (Schematic of System) (1) collate but envelope by hand (2) auto. address
(3) Rather than envelope, wrap auto. (4) Stor. Unit 24 may feed to 32 thereby
eliminating need to mag. record or cards.

### Page 6
a variable, and it is not desirable to await the selection of one card before
manually effecting the selection of the next, an intermediate input storage
system 24 is provided for storing signals derived from the manual selector 22
and for reading out at least part of each selection signals group to be
magnetically recorded on the respective card for later use. The notation 26
refers to a card reading and recording device adapted to read the code on ~~ the
~~ each selected card which identifies it card and to transmit said code as a
feed-back signal to the intermediate storage and control system 24 whereafter
signals recorded therein relative to said card are transmitted to a recording
head 28 and recorded on the magnetic recording area of the card. The notation 27
refers to the reading transducers(s) for the cutouts or other means for ~~ in ~~
identifying the card, the output of which is the input to the intermediate
storage and control system and so is adapted to

effect the read-out of the code ~~ to ~~ stored therein which pertains to the
particular card in the recording section of 26 The numeral 29 refers to a
conveyor which is a continuation of the means for conveying the selected cards
from 20 thru the unit 26 and is adapted for carrying said cards to a card feeder
30 for which the automatic printing machine 34 which may comprise, in general,
apparatus such as the Copyflo 24 manufactured by Haloid Xerox, Inc. of
Rochester, New York. From the card feeder ^30 the cards are individually fed
thru an optical system whereupon an image of each is projected onto a selenium
plated drum and transferred as a print to a sheet of paper 33 provided from a
roll as a belt which passes out of the machine 34 and is cut into individual
lengths or pages by means of automatic cutting apparatus 37. After each card is
optically scanned, it is automatically fed into a card receiver and scanner 32
the operation of which is synchronized

### Page 7
{{page}} to the movement of the belt 33 of moving print. The unit 32 effects the
scanning of the signals temporarily recorded on the magnetic recording area of
the card and transmits these as a plurality of control signals to apparatus for
automatically collating, stapling or binding plural pages of the matter printed
in 34 and enveloping an order for one or more of said sheets or pamphlets. The
unit 38 is an automatic collating machine and 39 is an automatic stapling or
binding device. The unit 40 effects the en  placement of one or more sheets,
{{strikethrough}} or {{/strikethrough}} pamphets, or multiple stapled copies of
reproduction, from the printer, 34. A fourth unit 41 may be provided to print
the address of the recipient or customer on the envelope. Units 38 to 41 are
responsive to control signals reproduced from the cards as they pass thru the
reader 32. The notations 32'a, 32'b, 32'c and 32'd refer to delay means in the
{{/page}}

inputs to 38 to 41 strikethrough}} {{?}} {{/strikethrough}} and/or relay storage
means adapted for assuring that the functions controlled by the temporary
recordings on the cards occur at the proper instant. It is noted that if the
intermediate storage and control system 24 is modified and connected directly to
the reader 32, ~~st it will not be necessary to record control signals for
controlling 38 to 41 on each card. The reader and controller 24 may be provided
in one of a number of forms each of which is adapted to receive and store coded
information in the form of a ~~ pulse trains or the like, each of which

feeder 30 in the order they are completed. A compromise control system is shown
on pages 43 and 44. The control consists of a rotary switch 51 consisting of a
pulse operated stepping motor 51-2 adapted to rotate an arm 51-1 one switching
position each time a pulse is fed to the input of the stepping motor.

described is to be used by the Patent Office in storing & reproducing copies of

reproduce the parallel codes recorded on the selection code storage drum 24
which is in constant motion as described. When the code reproduced from the drum
~~ is ~~ 24a is equal to the code appearing on the outputs 78 of the
photomultiplier scanning bank 77, the code matching relay 24d provides a control
signal on its output 24d'. If only a single column of images is provided on 73,
the signal may be used to gate the video picture signal derived by scanning the
image frame present at the scanner camera. In the more elaborate system where
each of the cameras 60-I to 60-N scans a different column, a further control
circuit is provided for the selective ~~ playback ~~ gating of only that signal

### Page 28
The video picture signal derived from scanning the selected image frame is
passed thru an electronic gate which is operated when the selection code
reproduced from drum 24a corresponds with the frame indicating code reproduced
by reading bank 77 and relay 24d becomes energized. The pulse output of 24d is
used to effect two control actions. At is utilized to close a normally open,
mono-stable electronic gate 60 which is slow-to-open and remains closed for a
time period while the drum 24a rotates thru an angle ~~ equal to ~~ in which ~~
at ~~ essentially the ~~ are ~~ elemental strip area thereof, which pertains to
said ~~ a ~~ single ~~ selection ~~ parallel selection code passes ~~ a ~~ me
magnetic reproduction heads 68. The signal (or signals)reproduced by a read head
68 is related to the code which energizes 24d and is of a characteristic such
that it will effect the presetting of a rotary

switch 62 to effect the completion of a circuit ~~ between with the output of
camera 60 which ~~ between the output of that one of the cameras 60- which is
scanning the column of image frames in which the selected frame or frames is
located and is passing into the scanning field of said camera as the rotary
switch 62 is operated. While rotary switch 62 may be an electro-mechanical
stepping switch operated by a solenoid which steps at one portion each time a
pulse is received on the output of 68, it (62) is preferably an electronic
gating device such as a magnetron beam switching tube which has a much higher
switching rate. The signals recorded on the channel of the drum which is swept
by head 68 are thats adapted to ~~ prep ~~ operate rotary switch 62 in a manner
whereby the picture signal(s) gated thru 62 to the transducing means for
reproducing the corresponding optical or usual image or images for

### Page 29
photographic reproduction thereof, are those relating to the codes reproduced
from drum 24a which energize the matching relay 24d and ~~ are ~~ defined by the
signals reproduced by head 68 during the ~~ same ~~ time the elemental band
containing the parallel code passes the heads 24R1 to 24RN. In other words, the
code reproduced by heads 24R- is used to define the row in which the selected
frame appears and the head 68 reproduces the ~~ se ~~ series code or signals
defining the column in which said frame appears. If there are N positions to
rotary switch ~~ 62d ~~ 62 (i.e. N cameras scanning N columns of image frames )
and 62 is a pulse stepped on actuated electronic gate such as a beam switching
tube of N switching positions ), then the number of pulses reproduced by 68
during the interval gate 69 remains closed when passed to the switching control
62' of switch 62, will determine the

switching position of 62. Thus the band arca of 24a on which each parallel
selection code is recorded has also associated therewith one or more signals
which are recorded when the parallel code is recorded which signals may comprise
a series code or pulse train adapted for selectively positioning switch 62 to
pass ~~ there thru ~~ to its output 64 only the signal produced by the camera
scanning the selected image frame on the tape or belt 73. The control 62' for 62
contains an automatic control means such as a semi-conductor timing means for
maintaining the selected switching position, resulting from the action of the
signals passed thru gate 69, for a time interval necessary to pass the picture
signal generated on ~~ at ~~ the output 61- of the camera scanning the selected
image frame, to the output 64 of said switch 62, whereafter said control 62'
opens switch 62 so that no signal passes

to 64. The circuit 64 may connect directly to the input amplifier 65 ~~ of a ~~
for a video image producing device such as a picture storage tube 65 or image
writing tube which may directly convert said signals to a charge pattern or
latent image pattern on a sheet of paper, reference being made to the Videograph
printing equipment now available from the A. B. Dick Company of Chicago, Ill. ~~
Since ~~ If a plurality of tandem signals are made to appear on 64 and the speed
at which the image frames of conveyor 73 are moved and scanned is different than
that at which the printing paper and mechanism of the printing unit 34' is
operated, then an intermediate storage system ~~ 7070 cord is necessary ~~ 70
for the video picture signals is necessary between the output of the camera with
62 and the storage or picture

writing tube 65. Intermediary storage may be effected by means of a closed loop
magnetic tape or drum the servo drive means for which is operated by means of an
automatic controller such as an electronic multi-circuit, recycle timer which is
energized by the signal output of code matching relay 24d to drive the tape in
the proper manner to effect the recording of the video picture signal therein
each time a picture signal is passed to circuit 64. The intermediate storage
system 70 may also contain means therein for sorting the picture signals (i.e.
tape to tape transfer) which appear on 64 in a random or numerical order, into
groups as ordered. For example, if the system is used for patent retrieval, then
any single order for patents may require patents with numbers appearing in

### Page 31
different locations on the storage medium 73. By recording coded information
with each selection code on drum 24a, pertaining to the name and address of the
person placing the order, this information may be used to collate or group ~~
all ~~ signals passed to the intermediary storage 70, into order groups.
Intermediate Storage System & Printout Fig. 61 (p. 61) is a schematic diagram of
the (a possible) intermediate storage system 70 of Fig. 53. Picture signals
(composite with sync pulses) appearing on line 64 are passed to the single input
of a rotary stepping switch 73 and then over one of the multiple outputs 73'
thereof to a picture signal storage means 75 such as a charge storage tube or
continuously rotating magnetic drum adapted to store just one frame sweep
(composite) picture signal. The output 75' of each storage tube 75 is connected
to a respective magnetic recording head 77 adapted to record on a first
elongated closed loop magnetic tape 76 which is driven continuously in a closed
loop path over drums 76a and 76b by a contact speed gear motor drive 76'. Each
storage tube has a pulse actuated input trigger control means 75" which causes
its "read-bead" to read the charge pattern on the face of the tube and provide
the ~~red~~composite video picture signal on output 75' when pick-up head 78 is
energized by a pulse (or lack of pulse) on the tape which is indicative that no

Fig. 61

### Page 32
picture signal is present on that section of tape 76 being swept by record head
77. Switch 73 is stopped each time a picture signal passes therethru by passing
the composite video picture signal thru a vertical sync clipper 71, the clipped
pulse output of which energizes a time delay relay 72 which actuates stepping
motor 74 which steps 73 after the entire composite video picture signal has
passed thru to a respective storage tube 75. The control 75C for each storage
tube is automatic so that each time its trigger input is energized, it will
automatically provide an output picture signal and then become erased. The
notation 75 refers to a magnetic recording means for each tube which records on
76 not only the picture signal but code signal (series binary code) identifying
the picture signal. If the scanning means 60 (Fig. 53) are video cameras or the
like, then the code reproduced by the photomultiplier heads 77 will necessarily
be converted in a shift register to a series binary code and presented on 64
either preceding or following the picture signal associated therewith. The code
may also be an optical part of the frame field scanned (along a strip area above
or below the picture in the so call blanking or back porch region) Whereupon it
will be part of the picture signal and may be derived for selection purposes by
clipping the picture signal in the blanking interval and passing the resulting
series pulse train to a series to parallel shift register the output of which is
connected to code matching relay 87. The next function is to selectively
reproduce and separate and record all picture signals pertaining to image frames
which pertain to respective orders. A plurality of magnetic recorders 81 are
provided for this purpose. The control event

for each of the recorders is illustrated in part in the diagram associated with
recorder-reproducer unit ~~ and ~~ 81-1 and in part in the diagram for 81-3. The
tape 82 of each recorder unit 81 is used both as a control signal recording
medium and as a means ~~ fall ~~ for recording information signals. The control
signal input is illustrated in the diagram for unit 81-1. The operator of the
input selector 22 sets up a parallel binary code on a plurality of output lines
100 by manually ~~ open ~~ closing switches. (ref diagrams pp. 29 and 32). The
parallel code developed on lines 100 is indicative of the order number. It is
converted to a series code in a shift register 101 which code is passed thru a
rotary stepping switch 102 to the recording inputs of one of the records 81. The
series code introduced on the output 101' of 101 after passing thru switch 102
is transmitted over two currents, (1) 103a which is an input to a shift register
106 which converts it to parallel code in multiple output circuits 107 which
record the code in parallel on tape 82 of 81. ~~ 106 ~~ Shift register 106 is
preferably with a plurality of holding relays or slow-to-open after-closing
switches on each of the lines 107 which retain each energized line thereof in a
state of energization for a sufficient period of time to permit the parallel
code to be recorded on the entire length of tape 82 driven

relay 104 which maintains an output signal (gates a power supply) to energizing
a bank of erase heads 108 for erasing all prior signals on the tape 82 including
picture and code signals

energizing input of a multi-current, repeat cycle timer which  of  starts and
stops the servo drive 84 to drive at least the complete length of the tape 82
past the heads. Each recorder 81 is also provided with gating control means for
recording on its tape only those picture signals stored on tape 76 which are
recorded with or identified by the same code existing  and  along the entire
length of tapes 81 (i.e. the order parallel code lines 100 extend also to one

order code reproduced from 76 by heads 80 is the same as that continuously
executing at heads 89 (recorded on the entire length of tape 82, relay 87
becomes energized and provides an output signal which effects several functions.
The output of 87 is passed to the energizing input of a multicircuit, self
recycling timer 87' which sequentially (a) starts drive motor 84 for  tape  the
transport of tape 82, (b) closes a gate 85 in the output of picture signal
reproduction head 79 whereby the selected picture signal is passed to a
recording head 86 riding on tape 82 and recorded thereon (c) energizes an erase
head 79E to erase the picture signal after it has been

reproduced from tape 76, (d) energizing a pulse signal recording head 79R' for
recording a signal adjacent the erased length of the tape 76 used which signal
may be later used to energize one of the heads 78. and (e) energizes the stop
control 84S of drive 84 to stop movement of 82 until the next next selected
picture signal is to be recorded. After all of checkmark the tapes 81 have had
containing selection videos have had all selected picture signals recorded
thereon, the signals on each tape may be reproduced (one tape at a time) and
transduced to image prints or photographic reproductions in the printer 95. The

drwing the prints. The lack of a pulse on the output f 97 indicates that all
picture signals have been reproduced from that type of recorder the reproduction
output of which is co 90L of which is connected 92 thru 91. The lack of output
from 97 may be used to effect the stepping of 91 to the next position so that
picture signals may be reproduced from the next tape in order. The output of 97
is also connected to the reset input 99' of a time delay relay 99 (continued on

Aug. 15 1951 INTRODUCTION This notebook is intended ~~ to ~~ as a record of the
conceived inventions and progress in the development of electrical toys. The
inventor is completing a patent application, as this is written, on electrical
wheeled toys employing some of the basic manufacturing techniques to be
discussed in detail and utilized in the fabrication of the toy inventions to be
described. Many of the inventions to be listed and (or) sketched and described
in detail have already been recorded by individual sheets which have been
witnessed by the inventors brother and, mailed to record the date. In addition,
Mr. Richard Blum of Mock & Blum has also witnessed a number of inventions on
paper of his firm Mr. Alex Friedman and Mr. Levy, know, have known of my basic
vehicle invention since I first discussed it with ~~ them ~~ Richard Blum last
January. Mr. Edward Baggott of Murdock Ave, Queens will be shown my present
patent drawings and some drawings relating to some of the ramifications of this
toy and proposed manufacturing techniques. Jerome Lemelson Aug 15-51 Witnessed

Aug. 15, 1951 Electrical Toys and Games Employing Printed, Stamped or Sprayed
Circuits. About nine months ago the author conceived of the possibility of
applying some of the present circuit application techniques to model toys and
games in combination preferably with electrical insulation materials such as
thermo-setting (plastic) JHL. and general plastic materials, paper, wood, etc.
These techniques involve printing, spraying, painting metals or metallic
materials which are capable of conducting an electric current to the
nonconducting surface of a game or toy. It is conceived that properly developed
manufacturing techniques for applying these conducting strips to toys would
enable their fabrication at a considerably lower cost than an item fabricated ~~
whi ~~with conducting elements such as wires (soldered), rods ~~ st~~. These
techniques could conceivably be applied to such items (to be described in
detail) as: (1) Toy vehicles and tracks (2) Toy vehicle games (utilizing a track
on a playing surface (3) Toy games utilizing circuits to create a variety of
electrically actuated effects. (4) General electrical toys.

August 15, 1951 Since I intend to file my first patent application in about a
week I am attempting to record most of my conceived ideas in this field at this
time Manufacturing Techniques and Devices: (1) Application of conducting element
by contact (printing or rolling). The conducting material may be a metal applied
in the molten state, a current conducting plastic applied as a liquid which
hardens upon cooling or sets after exposure to air, a powdered metal with a
bonding agent, etc. (A) Printing thru a porous plate: (Sintered metal, etc) (i)

Porous Metal, etc. SUB-RESERVOIR FOR MOLTEN METAL, etc CONTACT, FORCE THRU METAL
(PRESSURE) & WITHDRAW Plastic or other INSULATED SURFACE (ii) Use of Porous Drum
or Roller for applying a stripe or other conducting element(s) to a surface.

Aug. 15-1951 TEMPLATE AND SPRAYER: (AUTOMATIC) (A) WORK MOVES ACROSS SPRAYER For
~~ pain ~~ applying stripes of conducting material to such items as toy tracks,
roadbed, etc., the technique may suffice to have the work secured to a bed which
rides in front of a ~~ metal ~~ spray gun for metals, current conducting
plastics etc. while the latter applys the coating as a strip or circuit.

according to the shape of a template Applying A STRIP of ~~ THIN ~~ SHEET METAL
TO MOLTEN PLASTIC. (A) Apply during molding operation (REQUIRES SPECIAL MOLD
WITH NECESSITY OF SETTING up for each run unless automatic feeding of sheet
(stamped) is including. (B) Apply by heating thermosetting plastic in area where
sheet is to be applied (viz - by appling sheet hot) If, for example, a thin

Aug 15-1951 strip is ~~ to bonded ~~ applied to a plastic which is in a
semi-molten state, it will be bonded to the latter when it solidifies. One
technique of applying a thin strip of metal is as follows:

Another fabricating technique would be to pore a thin layer of the metal into a
cavity or indentation in the surface of the plastic and allow it to solidify. In
this technique, the metal could be made to flow a slit in the dispenser as the
work moves with respect to the latter. These techniques will be further
investigated and one or more may be worked out ~~ with ~~ possibly with Ed
Baggott. One more technique is to roll a current conducting material on a drum
or plate (transfer it to) and then transfer it to the insulating (plastic)
material. Toys and Games

may be fabricated of plastics, paper, or other insulating material and ~~ any of
~~ circuits applied utilizing one or more of the discussed techniques,
presenting a cheap electrical toy which may by mass produced with a minimum of
hand labor for wiring, assembly, etc. Some of the following listed items which
have been conceived by the author have been previously recorded and witnessed.
They are presented here again for the benefit of classification and to be
recorded formally in a witnessed notebook in the event of future litigation.
Toys: 1. Toy vehicles, driving motor and simple plastic track. (Patent will be
applied for) 2. Toy train or vehicle and multiple circuits (also to be included
in patent): having a series of electrically operated devices 3. Toy vehicle with
lateral movement possible by utilizing a remotely actuated solenoid to turn
vehicle wheels. (recorded) 4. Toy model airplane - a vehicle having a driving
motor, and having a moveable arm secured there to, a model airplane Aug. 15,
1951 secured to said arm, said arm being capable of traversing a fixed path as
the vehicle moves or said arm being controlled by a motor within said ~~ vec ~~
vehicle which in turn is controlled remotely, giving the effect of the airplane
taking off, flying, and landing as the vehicle moves across the surface tracks.
5. A toy vehicle (automobile) having such remotely controlled accessories as (a)
toy lights turned on and off remotely, (b) brakes applied remotely (c) horn
remotely controlled (d) windshield wiper remoted turned on and off (e) doors
opened remotely (f) tail lights, (g) turns controlled remotely, etc. These may
be done in accordance with the multiple circuits to be described in my pending
patent or by using current pulses of different voltage or amperage ranges to
operate each device. (6) A toy vehicle or object driven by a vibrating type
motor mounted within said vehicle. The motor would transmit forced pulsations in
one direction to move the vehicle or would vibrate elements extending from the
base of the vehicle in one direction to exert a series of pulses on said element
and drive Witnessed by: Howard Lemelson Aug 15, 1951 Witnessed D Julius Lemelson

vibrated by a small motor to cause a column of gas ~~ ente ~~ in a tube
extending from the piston or diaphragm to vibrate and propell the vehicle. (8)
Jumping Toy - a solenoid in the base of the toy acting against the track to
cause the toy to jump with respect to the surface. GAMES AND VEHICLE - SURFACE
TOYS. (1) Toy Racing Games - Recorded Techniques in circuitry design (a)
Crossing two or more surface elements without shorting. (1) Apply an insulating
~~ lo ~~ coating to one element in the neighborhood of coating and then cross ~~
of ~~ over with the other element. (2) Stop one element short on each side of
the other and bring it around underneath by utilizing a ~~ clip or other ~~
Y-shaped conductor element. viz.

Aug 15 - 1951 (b) Connecting to elements ~~ with ~~ design element strip with a
projecting section which is secured to the power lead viz. This is done so that
there will not be a projection above the surface of the strip on the latter (2)
Toy Vehicle Board - Traffic Control game. The board consists of a shaped surface
made of an insulating material such as a plastic which is placed a series of
crossing vehicle guiding lanes with means for conducting electrical energy to
drive motors in the vehicle. Control may be had (left, right turning, reversing
etc) by utilizing separate circuits consisting in part of thin, narrow current
conducting strips on the surface of the road bed each contacted by a separate
brush or wheel to conduct the current in the circuit associated with that strip
to the electrical device in the vehicle, in this case a solenoid ~~wih ~~ which
is linked to the wheel turning mechanism or, and perhaps a little more difficult
an arrangement, is one in which the solenoid is actuated by a voltage pulse,

the main circuit which supplies current to the vehicle, a ~~ plu ~~ pulse which
is of a higher voltage than the line voltage, which actuates the solenoid
momentarily and turns the wheels of the vehicle. Another technique for
controlling the path of the vehicle across the board, would be to supply ~~ ele
~~ projecting elements which could be applied to the board in advance of the
actual ~~ ly ~~ run which would govern the course of the vehicle by deflecting
it or otherwise turning it. Still another technique for the vehicle ~~ board ~~
path control would involve the ~~ rul ~~ utilization of a special board having
elements which may be remotely caused to project from the surface of the board
~~ or ~~ to affect the path of the vehicle or otherwise be controlled to affect
the vehicle path (to be worked out) Toy Games: Toss Games(A) Several games have
been conceived utilizing circuits which may

Aug 15 1951 be cheaply applied to a non-conducting surface. If, for example, a
game is made whereby the object is to toss a current conducting element such as
a coin on a surface to cause a bell to ring or a light to light up (i.e. short a
circuit with a coin) the following techniques may be utilized in laying out the
surface with the conducting elements. (i.e. game layout)

Strips 1 and 2 form a circuit with a power supply (battery) P and bell or buzzer
(B) which is not complete until a coin or current conductor (3) shorts the
circuit by resting across the circuit ~~ s ~~ elements (1) & (2) where they are
close together. So as not to confuse the game, the elements (1) & (2) may be
covered with an opaque paint in the areas where the targets (contacting areas)
are not located and a target may be painted around said contacting area.

This is a variation in the above with the darkened sections representing
conducting layers on the surface of the playing board. J Lemelson Aug 15-51

PIN BALL GAMES: If a large current conducting ball is employed, it may be used
to short (or close) a current by rolling over and simultaneously contacting two
conducting surface elements which are form in a common circuit and are closely
shaped together, the ball acting to slow the circuit temporarily, viz:

Game Employing a variable Rheostat and Electrically Operated Toy Vehicle or
Figures This is a game of chance whereby a constant voltage power supply ~~ such
~~ is utilized, ~~ and ~~ in series with a variable resistor which may be varied
by

Aug. 15, 1951 spinning to give a variable voltage to vehicles on the playing
board, thereby causing d.c. motors in vehicles traveling over said board to run
at ~~ a ~~ different speeds and drive said vehicle at different speeds. In other
words, a series of vehicle each ~~ identicle~~ having an identical power rated
motor are raced about a track each being supplied with current on a different
circuit. A variable ~~ potentiometer~~ (rheostat is placed in each circuit and
the voltage of that circuit is varied by chance, i.e. - by spinning etc. The
voltages are thus determined for each race or for part of each race by
successive spinnings or variations in the setting of the ~~ po~~ rheostat. The
rheostat may be printed directly on the surface of the playing board for
convenience and manufacturing economy viz.

Sept. 5, 1951 A patent pertaining to toy vehicles and track has been applied
for, filed last week. Continuing with a description. January 15-1952 Since
starting this notebook, the inventor has ended his relationship with Mr. Edmond
Baggott of Ideal Toy Co. (re: page 3) who, in the writer's opinion, display bad
faith in copying for the company, an idea in toy mechanisms which the writer
disclosed to him in January 1951. For this reason the contents of this notebook
were not disclosed to Baggott. I now have two prospects to ~~ go to ~~ approach
to ~~ back ~~ finance the venture of getting some of these devices on the
market, one a Mr. Abramson president of Raylite Incorporated and the other, a
Mr. Arthur Ross whom the author recently met, is looking for a business to go
into. Fabricating & Manufacturing Techniques (continued) It is conceived that a
process similar to the "letter press" printing process could be utilized to
transfer a current conducting material such as a plastic to a non conducting
surface for the purpose Witnessed: May 22, 1952 Howard Lemelson

of fabricating the devices, toys and games described in this notebook. This
would involve the transfer of the molten plastic from a drum or plate to the
printing surface and to the surface of the object to be printed If a thermo
setting plastic is utilized it may be necessary to heat the printing plate
during operation to prevent ~~ ive ~~ the plastic from solidifying on the
printing surface or "cut" as it is commonly called in the printing (ink) field.
Design of Printing Machine (assuming that heating of printing drum is required)

Roller A transfers molten plastic (conducting) or metal to raised surface
elements of (cut) drum (B). Drum (B) is heated on the the inside by a gas heater
or electrical heater (D) and kept hot so that the plastic or metal will not
solidify on the drum. This plastic or metal is transferred from the raised
sections of drum (D) (E) to (over) Witnessed: Howard Lemelson, May 22, 1952

June 2-1952 I have just received copies of patents referred to in my first
office action to my patent on this topic. These I will turn over to my patent
attorney who will prepare a report of for Author Ross regarding patentability,
etc. Mr. Blum (my attorney) has been given a collection of drawings and
descriptions regarding conceptions of devices, manufacturing techniques, product
simplification, etc on this topic: These include a number of the ideas which
were shown diagramatically or discussed with Mr. Ross. Under manufacturing
techniques such things as automatic machinery for lubricating playing surfaces &
track (re: pp. 6, 7, etc of this book and a special report I prepared for Ross,
including possible methods for grinding; blasting, etc the surface of the track
to make the conductor adhere; techniques for making a cross over conductors;
etc. a technique for ~~ smoth ~~ smoothing a sprayed metal surface element to
(re. p. 11) which J. Lemelson June 6-52 Also not previously recorded was the
conception of spraying a conductor onto a relatively flexible sheet of

two objects which comprise a ~~ conduc ~~ non conducting base having conducting
elements coated or bonded thereto, I have already suggested in my patent
application #244557 and in my notes that the flexible qualities of the base be
utilized for the mechanical joining of the two elements or units and that the
conducting strips or elements be extended right into the area of contact of the
joined (flexed) pieces to continue the electrical circuit from one piece to the
other. Other means have been conceived for electrical joining of device of this
nature and, I will ~~ here ~~ now attempt to classify them in an orderly manner:
viz: Plug-in Connection: In my patent application I disclose how a male fitting
having a conducting layer extending thereon or partially there on may ~~ fitte
~~ be fitted into a cavity or hole having a conducting layer extending therein
from the surface to continue the circuit. ~~ viz ~~ this may be applied to a
device where it is desired to plug-in a wire or tip jack to extend or continue
the circuit. viz.

The flexible qualities of the plug-in or of the material of the ~~ plastic ~~
non-conducting base A may be utilized to hold the plug-in in place. The entire
hole and the immediate surrounding area may be coated with the conductor to
guarantee electrical contact. Snap-on Devices. In my pat application I showed
how the flexing qualities of the nonconducting base may be utilized to hold to
hold two units together & electrically join them. An embodiment of this could
be:

This device C may be an accessory unit pluggin in parallel on the playing board

Clips.- If clips are used to tie into the main line - ~~ a simp ~~ a conceivable
simple approach is to extend the line to the edge of the board & clip ~~ p ~~

Note: The general ideas ~~ of ~~behind the thoughts of the inventor are to
simplify the fabrication of these electrical devices with conducting layers
thereon to ~~ reduce ~~ eliminate the necessity of using fasteners, wires, or
other components which are usually necessary when the conventional methods of
electrical fabrication are employed, thus reducing cost. The general ideas are
two fold in considering the fabrication of devices in this category and
electrical devices which have conducting layers on a flexible non conductive
base which must be assembled and (or) disassembled by the user namely. (1)
Simplicity of fabrication by having but one molding operation followed by an
operation ~~ duri ~~ to apply the conducting layer(s). and. (2) Simple methods
for joining wherein the flexing qualities of the material are utilized and (or)
taper fits which may also utilize the flexing of the parts together with the
idea of bringing the coated layers or conducting elements

into the area of joining preferably actually coating of the male fittings and
the female cavities; over the edges, under the board, etc. Jerome Lemelson June
6-52 Witnessed & Understood By Helen Kuhn June 6, 1952 Howard Lemelson June 6,
1952 James Lemelson June 6-1952 September 18-1952 Called Mr. Arthur Ross a week
ago to request financial aid in purchase of equipment to make models. He claimed
he is not interested at the time being, due to other financial and business
obligations. Visited Metallizing Co. of 8-11 43rd Rd. Queens. And, after seeing
a demonstration of their metlalizing gun (metal spray gun) I intend to by buy
the research model. which will cost about $200-. Concerning the use of these
sprayed metal coating as conducting mediums I have

### Page 21
conceived of the following processing technique. The Schori, Mogul, etc. spray
systems provide a metallic coating on a base which has a surface roughness
proportional to the mesh of the powder used, or if wire is used, proportional to
the parameters of the process. In other words the spraying technique as
developed today do not afford a smooth finish. For toy or general electrical
applications of these thin metallic coatings where there is a sliding contact
between a brush and the coating on a base, this rough finish is undesirable as
it will tend to wear down the contactor or brush. A process is conceived in
which metal is prayed on a base (for toy track where the layer of metal serves
as the third rail and ground to conduct current to the toy vehicle) and the
resulting pattern is polished or buffed smooth as follows. (A) Technique "A" -
The metal is sprayed on a high surface such as a projecting rail

Sept 18, 1952 A mask M is placed first over the non-conducting base (B)
permitting only the rails R to project above the surface of the mask. The
conducting layer of metal (L) is then sprayed on. With the mask still in place
the layer L is then buffed, grinded or smoothed down by particle blasting. The
mask M is removed and the rails then have a conductive coating thereon forming a
complete ~~ cl~~ circuit when electircally connected with a power supply (B)
Technique B involves ~~the~~ preferably the use of a durable mask M over a
Technique B flat surface (B) spraying a layer of metal (L) on the surface of
(H); keeping the mask in place and passing over with a soft buffing wheel or
particle blasing to smooth down the surface of L while the mask is in place. The
mask is then removed and used again

### Page 22
or discarded, while the base (B) is not affected by the smoothing operation.
Note: If (B) is a thin plastic or other ~~ non-magnetic ~~ sheet, magnets may be
used on the underside of (B) to hold the mask (M) on, eleminating the necessity
of using an adhesive for the mask (mask must of course be made of a magnetic
material. Technique C.Use of thin metalic sheet bonded to base for conducting
element - 1 Thin metallic sheet (possibly .02 - .10" ~~ } ~~ thick) die stamped
to shape and held by a holding device employing suction means to hold it in
place, ~~ p ~~ or magnetic means if sheet is paramagnetic, prior to placing on
base of toy (which would preferably be plastic or paper) has been conceived as a
cheap means for applying the conducting element. If the base is thermoplastic
the ~~ sheet of ~~ metal pattern may be secured to said base by (a) use of
adhesives (b) by heating base just below pattern using electronic or radio heat
techniques (c) by induction heating the metal sheet causing the thermoplastic
material ~~ in contact ~~ of the base which is in contact with the strip to melt
and fuse with the strip.

(C) Utilizing plastics which are conductive sprayed on to a nonconducting
    plastic or paper base. I have experimented during the past two months with
    various plastics such as cellulose acetate, Krylon (acrylic base) Kylon (a
    cold setting plastic), vinyl base plastics, etc. all heavily loaded with
    carbon or a conducting mortor ~~ mar ~~ marketed by the Atlas Mineral
    Company called Conductoplast without success at low currents (and voltages
    ~~ 6 ~~ 1 1/2 to 6 volts.) I know that Chrysler Motors has a conducting
    plastic which is efficient at higher voltages. I intend to continue to
    experiment to obtain an efficient conducting plastic which preferably may be
    applied to a non conducting base by printing. Jerome Lemelson Sept 18, 1952
    Additional material Sept. 18, 1952 Light Bulb Socket as conceived some time
    ago in which sprayed metal or conducting medium is applied to a formed base
    (no assembly operations necessary) See the sketch on the next page.

    Bulk snaps in J Lemelson Sept 20, 52 September 20, 1952 Purchased a model
    "L" Schon powder pistol from Schoric process Corp. of L. A. City together
    with necessary equipt to spray aluminum & Zinc. Worked four hours at 1160
    Bway, Brooklyn trying to spray metal on various surfaces. There is not a
    good bond of zinc to plastic such as styrene unless the surface is very
    rough. The layer of metal that remains on after spraying easily scrapes off.
    I propose to prepare the surface of a plastic such as polystyrene or acetate
    by first applying a thinner or plasticized to the surface of the plastic and
    then while the plastic surface is still soft or molten, spraying on said
    coating of said metal or prepare the surface by particle blasting or crazing
    with a thinner.

Games employing conducting layers on non-conducting surfaces. The following
games were conceived over a year ago employing a pattern applied to a surface of
thin metallic sheeting or sprayed metal. The Toss Toys have been conceived in
which a metallic object such as a coin, etc. is tossed on a surface having a
conducting pattern thereon part of said pattern being separated ~~from sam ~~
electrically from the other half of said pattern, each half the positive and
ground of an electric current, a bell, light, buzzer or other device in series
with the power supplying, the pattern being so arranged on the surface that the
coin ~~which it ~~ when it falls on different positions on the board completes a
circuit involving each of the patterns the bell or light and the power supply or
battery thus actuating the lighted bell. This differs from an amusement device
(electrical) used in amusement parks in that the entire electrical pattern is on
one surface reducing the operations necessary to tie-in to the back of the
board. (over)

been working on a patent application for the past three months on the
embodyments of this notebook and expect to file it within the next week or so. A

surface upon which the wheels ride and contacting strips slide appears to work
best at present. There are conducting plastics which conceivably when sprayed on
a surface would blend with the base plastic or could be rolled on the surface to
form these strips. The preferable conceived method is to prepare the base by
forming or blasting to hold the conducting layer (note the board layout refered
to on p 16 wherein everything is applied to one playing surface including
switch, playing board, battery box, etc (the surface being formed with a vehicle
guiding means thereon) has also been built (last September) Item B in the Figure
at the top of p. 17 could conceivably be both an electrical device such as a
light, bell, etc in series with an electrical counter which would record the
number of times the ball struck the post or wall (p. 16.) The following game
device has also been conceived as a low cost approach to recording the passage
of a pin ball thru a hole in the playing board (or placement of a pinball in a
cavity or indentation in the playing surface). (a) Indentation in playing
surface

Ball rolls into cavity C. (over)

### Page 25
which has strips S1 & S2 extending therein said strips being extensions of an
electrical circuit being broken within the cavity C and spaced close together
therein so that a ball made of an electrically conducting material when rolled
into the cavity C and resting therein will complete the circuit causing the
light to flash on or a buzzer to ring, etc. The entire conducting strip layout
may be applied to the playing surface thus eliminating the need of costly
assembly operations which would be present if it were necessary to pass
conducting elements thru the board from the blind face or using connectors, etc.
B refers to the cavity backstop which may be formed integrally with the playing
surface. (B)

In this arrangement a hole is formed in the upper playing surface P1 and a lower
surface P2 is provided for blind return of the balls to the actuating mechanism
(not shown) Conducting strips S1 & S2 are patterened about P2 and brought close
together Jerome Lemelson 3/13/53 Witnessed by Howard Lemelson 3-13-53

near the vicinity of the holes so that the ball when it falls there the hole
will complete a circuit as it stripes P2. (Re:p.16) viz: strips (circuit is
completed as ball touches both strips at once The game shown on pp. 34,35 could
conceivably made into a magnetic toss game wherein the tossed object would be a
magnet and the conducting pattern a sheet of steel secured to the ~~c ~~on
conducting surface. The following game has been conceived.

above causes the object to move thereabouts, the object has means for completing
the electric circuit when it moves across the two separated strip segments. The

the circuit as it crosses the closely spaced strips. April 4, 1953 Scolite For
the record, as I seem to have missplace a self mailed letter recording the date
of conception of the following device I am herebye recording its conception and
reduction to practice I am working on a patent application covering the device
which I expect to have ready for filing in about a month. Fig. 1 Flashing or
Flickering Reflective Surfaces: The numeral 1 refers to a reflex- reflector
(possibly the type known commercially as Scotch Lite) Placed over the surface of
the sheet of Scotch Lite 1 is a plastic or clear glass sheet 2, the front
surface of which is formed with a series of indentations or cylindrical
projections 2, the clear surface of which is formed with a series of
indentations 4. A light beam passing thru 3 is reflected as

a cone of light back to the observer who is traveling with the light by the
reflex reflector 1. As the angle of the light beam charges, the returning light
is interferred with by the formations 3 and 4 causing it to flash or flicker off
until the light ~~ is ~~ again appears to the observer. Other forms of this
reflector and related advertising devices will be disclosed in my pending
application. This device was reduced to practice in January 1953 with the aid of
Mr. Robert Kraushaar, optical physicist of New York University. Jerome Lemelson

in which the arm rests by gravity in the groove of the record. Certain of my toy
designs such as the walkie-talkie may have to be played with the record rotating
about a horizontal axis. Others such as the vehicle mounted record player toys
may be easily jarred while playing and light spring biassing may be necessary to
assure continued operation. Sam Freimauer informed me that he intends to make
the groves of the records .003 to .005" deep to reduce possibility of the needle
coming out of the groove when played by gravity. (b) Another suggestion I made
to Sam Freimauer was that he extend one of the pins or shafts of the spring

Feb. 22, 1960 Subject - Solar Cigarette Lighter Using my Hobby Vac vacuum

several interesting product design capabilities. In the first place, the box
portion B surrounding the bowl or reflector portion A provides substantial
support to A permitting thinner material to be use. Secondly, if backed with a
sheet of cardboard or plastic C bonded to the flange B', the item may be
produced cheaply and the assembly may comprise part of the container for the
lighter. The following new ideas are conceived for mounting the cigarette holder
by cigarette holder viz Fig. 2

cigarette is supported not by the ~~pa ~~reflector section A of the plastic
sheet 10 but by the base sheet 12 to which it is riveted or adhered as in Fig.
3'. Wire form G holds the cigarette and plug into a hole H in F. The material of

START In Figs. 5 to 8 is shown the application of a flexible pull strip of the
type described for the quick and amplified opening of a pouring spout such as
the metal or plastic pouring spout generally provided on the upper portion of
the side-walls of paper cereal containers or containers of salt. Such spouts are
generally of the shape illustrated in Fig. 5 and consists of a metal U-shaped
stamping 34 having flat side-walls 34b and 34c of somewhat triangular shape and
a central ~~tro~~ wall ~~ or tro ~~ 34a forming a trough along which the powder
or granular material flows MW 9/20/60 THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ & UNDERSTOOD

wall of the container ~~ such as 32 in Fig.6 and paper is l ~~ as illustrated in
Fig.6 with the sides 34a and 34b of the spout 34 penetrating the wall of the box

and time consuming task if a sharp knife or razor blade is not available. In the
structure illustrated in Figs. 5 to 8 a plastic or foil pull strip is secured to
the spout and projects through a slit in the paper wrapped around the box in a
manner whereby it may be pulled by grasping between the thumb and forefinger and
will effect the outward floating of the spout to a pouring position MW 9/20/60

discussed with the Andersons. (a)My ideas for modular lenticular reflectors
which piece together to form a large sign. Discussed was a 12" x 12" unit in
which the edges are shaped to align each with the next module and to retain them
together. (b) The idea of extruding and printing on the rear face of the lends

lenticular surface is coated or covered with a transparent plastic material of a
different index of refraction than the material of the lends sheet itself. The
above ideas and others were discussed when they questioned me about the various
facets about applying my Reflecting Display Device to highway use. The Aldersons
agreed, that they would cooperate in the production of samples if I would

certain suggestions which I had conceived, viz. (a) Coating by spray or rolling
on the food concentrate on the flat paper stock which is thereafter formed to

subject of food, I also disclosed to M. Russel Dock ideas I had conceived for
the following. (1) Idea of injecting colorants and/or foods into fruits or
vegetables to improve their appearance and/or taste. For example, grapefruit or

January 10, 1961 (Enroute to Washington) I visited Thomas Scarpa, president of
International Ultrasonic Corp., Cranford, N.J. yesterday and discussed my soon
to issue patent for Ultrasonic Apparatus with him yesterday. Additional designs,
modifications and applications for this ducted transducer were suggested by me
to him as follows – (a) Use of the ducted ultrasonic transducer of constant
outside diameter shown in my patent application - Ultrasonic Apparatus for (1)
Cleaning or unblocking clogged pipes by directing it therein on the end of a
flexible conduit and operating the transducer per se. I also suggested, and will
file an application on a transducer arrangement with the end of the duct
surrounding the transducer being servo driven to tilt, rotate or angulate while
in the pipe to (a) assist in the unblocking action (b) clean the wall of the
pipe, (c) inspect the inside of the pipe. I also conceive of combining a small
television camera adjacent the transducer or with any electrical or mechanical
(rooter) to visually see what is going on during or before or after the
unblocking action. (2) Mentioned to Scarpa was the possibility of using my
ducted tool as a probe to place into a liquid for chemical reactions (a drawing
Figs. 1 to 5 was left with him) THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ AND UNDERSTOOD by

(7) Provision of removable adaptors or duct ends of my device for cleaning
ultrasonically such articles as (disclosed to Scarpa) (a)spark plugs (on the
engine block or removed), which adaptor heads include shaped rubber nose
portions to circumscribe the part, (b) to fit over nuts, bolts, etc. to remove
rust, seizing, calking, etc (8)Provision of an end adapter for my ducted tool
which clamps on (by closure of jaws, etc - and seals around a work piece having
an irregular or expanding shape; and transducer which may be automatically
operated after admission of liquid ~~ to ~~ resulting closed chamber to move
about and scan surface of work as it operates thereon. (9) Also discussed with
Thomas Scarpa was my idea for designing my ultrasonic tool in the shape of a
pistol grip or gun the trigger of which would be coupled to a switch for
energizing the transducer and/or simultaneously admitting a liquid to the
chamber surrounding the transducer. A particular control arrangement would be
one in which a single trigger or switch JL Jan 10, 1961 THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER

actuation would result in the simultaneous actuation of the transducer and
admission of a liquid to the chamber surrounding the transducer (either
predetermined quantity of liquid or continuous flow thereof out the chamber or
circulated therein while nose is in sealing engagement with the work). When the
switch or trigger is released or opened, the transducer energy input is cut off
and either the liquid flow (valve) is closed or the action includes removal of
all liquid from the chamber. JL Jan 10, 1961 I have been working on patent

defines one end of 22 against which an edge of the card 12 is placed when
placing said card thru the opening 21 for alignment with reading means situated
within 20'. During the reading function, the card 12 is driven in two
directions, first a predetermined distance into the housing as directionally
defined by arrow *A* and then in a direction normal thereto in the direction
defined by arrow *A'.* The degree of movement into the housing in the direction
of "A" is sufficient to center the row or rows of binary (or numerical)
recordings to be read by fixed transducers 31 when the card is driven normal
thereto in direction A' to produce a binary serial code on output 31W. which, as
stated, may extend to a computer, recorder, transmitter, etc. A first drive
means for the card comprises a plurality of elongated rolls which functionally
engage and  the card after it has entered the housing until the card is
prepositioned within the housing after which certain of the rolls retract
automatically after other rolls engage the card for moving it laterally thru the
housing and out an opening 21' in end-wall 20-4 during which lateral movement

secured to a partition 20-7 which extends between the side-walls of the housing.
A plurality of upper rollers 27 are power operated by a motor 30 to drive the
card into the housing when engaged against its upper surface. The rollers ~~ and

used to stop drive motor 30 although 30 may be in constant rotation. The relay
31'R in the output 31'W of 31' is also adapted to advance input 36F of a second
solenoid 36 which advances a second ~~ group of ~~ roller or rollers 33 against
the card to drive it laterally thru the housing in the direction of A'. The
drive rolls 33 comprise two rollers 33a and 33b made of rubber or other suitable
material which rotate about lateral axes and cooperate with free wheeling rolls
32a and 32b when advanced against the surface of the card. A frame 3d supports
rollers 33 in bearing and drive motor 35 which is operatively coupled through
and conventional gear drive to the shaft of ~~at/~~the roll 33a and/or 33b by
means of a belt or chain drive (not shown). The output of transducer pickup 31'
is used both to effect retraction of the first drive roll assembly containing
rolls 27a and 27b and the advancing of the assembly 33 to engage rolls 33a and
33b against the card in cooperation with rolls 32a and 32b. After the card has
been driven out of the housing, a second limit switch 38 mounted on end wall
20-4 and having an over-ride actuator arm which momentarily closes a set of
contacts when it rides ~~of ~~ over the end edge of the card as it passes out

or on another column thereof which signals are indicative of which entries were
made last and/or which should be reproduced. If the column 12-10 is a magnetic

Fig. 7 is a schematic diagram of the electrical controls for the card reader
devices of Figs. 4 to 6. It is assumed, for the purpose of presenting a
simplified drawing, that the correct power supply is provided on the correct
sides of all switches, relays, controls, etc. The electrical system will be
described by describing a cycle of operation. Limit switch 25 is actuated when
the card enters the slot in the housing 20 and pulses or energizes the start
control 30F of motor 30 and the  projection  advance input 29F of solenoid 29.
Drive rolls 29 drive the card into the housing until pick-up 31' senses a signal
or mark in column 12-10 which produces a pulse on the outputof the amplifier 31A
in the circuit of 31'. The pulse is passed to the stop control 30S of motor 30,
retract control 29R of 29,  projectio advance control input 36F of motor 35
Which then causes the card to be driven in the direction of A' with the pick-up
31 aligned with the row 12b to be read. Shown in Fig. 7 is a recording member 48
such as a paper or magnetic tape or recording film on a channel of which the
pulse train generated on the output of 31 is to be recorded. A recording
transducer 45a is shown positioned for recording on a predetermined channel of

The notation 43a refers to a ~~push button~~, switch such as a bi-stable
push-button or solenoid operated switch in the output of 31 the function of
which will be described. Since cards will be intermittently fed to reader 20, if
it is desired to space each message or pulse train close together it will be
necessary to ~~start and~~ stop the tape during the interval each new card is
being prepositioned in the machine. Actuation of switch 25 may therefore be
utilized to start the tape drive motor 46 by energizing the start input 46F
thereof which motor may be time controlled to run for the time interval
necessary for scanner 31 to reproduce from the entire row 12b it is scanning and
then automatically stopped. The pulse output of limit switch 25 is therefore
also passed to a time delay relay 47 which energizes the stop control 46S of
tape drive motor 46 at the proper time after starting. Upon exiting from the
reader, the card causes the over-ride limit switch 41 to become actuated which
pulses the stop control 35S of motor 35 and the retract control of 36R of
solenoid 36. The pulse output of 41 may also by passed to the servo 49 which
feeds the next card into reader 20. In the event that it is desired to

A switching means 43 is provided in the outputs of the card reading transducer

head 31" adjacent each row scanning head, which head 31" may scan a mark,
cut-out or pulse recording 12 P' in the column 12a which indicated that the code
on the adjacent 12b column is to be read out. The output of 31" is used to
energize a solenoid 31S, which is sufficiently slow to retract to retain a pair
of contacts 43-SW, in the circuit between the pick-up 31 and the output 31W' to
the recording transducer 45 or transmitter, for a time interval for the entire
respective row 12b of the card to the read. While the lower contact 43' of
switch contact pair 43 SW is movable by solenoid 3/5 to contact the upper point
43", the upper contact 43" is also movable to be retained against 43' by a
bi-stable actuator 43P or push-button. Thus, The actuator 43 may be manually
operated to predetermine which of the rows 12b will be reproduced from. It is
noted that each the contact closure solenoids 31S may also have an engizing

Assuming that pick-up transducer 31-a scans and reproduces a pulse from the
first sub-column of 12-10 to pass the heads 31-, then the output of 31-a is
passed thru a time delay relay 52b then thru a normally closed switch 50-b to
the switching input of a second ~~ m ~~ normally closed switch 51b which it
causes to open which opening is effected for the time interval in which the
entire row ~~ 12 of ~~ 12b of recordings passes all scanners so that the output
of 31-b which must pass thru 51-b will not be able to pass therethru. The time
delay interval of 52b is such that in the event that scanner-transducer 31b also
~~ reproduced ~~ scanned a mark or signal in the same sub-column of 12-10 that
31a scanned its first sensory marks or signal, the output of 31b will have
sufficient time, when passed to the switching input of normally closed switch
50b to effect the opening of said switch before the output of 31a is passed
therethru to open 51b. Switch 50b is therefore sufficiently slow-to-close to
permit the entire row scanned by 31b to be read. Similarly, the output of 52b is
passed thru normally closed switches 50c and 50d to open respective switches 51c
and 51d breaking the output circuits 31w-c and 31w-d from their respective THIS

parallel binary coding array on input lines 21 to a code matching relay 22, the
other inputs to which derive signals from scanning band area 13 ~~ 24 ~~ of the
film 25 containing frame and line indicating codes as described. The inputs to
the frame and line code matching relays 22a and 22b may also be energized by
selection codes obtained from recordings or magnetic tape 31. Pick -up head 36
reproduces sereal codes from 31 which are converted to parallel code in shift
register 37, the outputs of which energize respective holding relays in relay
bank 38 which gate power to respective of the lines 21 and retain the parallel
code therein until 38 is reset by a signal output of 22b indicating arrival of
the selected frame in alignment with the scanner Manual switch 36S when opened

Operation of the apparatus of Fig. 1 is as follows. Tape drive servo means 34
operates driving tape 31 until selection signal pick-up 36 reproduces a
selection code and video pick-up 35 reproduces a tone signal or code to which
relay 39 is responsive which transmits a signal to the stop control S of motor

driven on its transport until frame photomultiplier reading band 24a reading
code marks on strip 13a produce a parallel binary code which is transmitted to
the frame selection code matching relay 22a, which code is equal to the
selection code set up on the inputs 21 whereupon the output 22W of 22a becomes
energized with a signal which is passed to

photomultiplier bank 24b reads the row code on strip 13b equivalent to that set
up on the inputs 21 to 22b ~~ set up ~~, the output of relay 22b is passed to
start motor 34 and head 35 reproduces the next signal on channel 31b of tape 31
which is passed to writing scanner 30, the beam of which it modulates to create
the desired image on the selected strip area or lateral row of the selected
frame of film 25. This may be accomplished with the film 25 in motion or stopped
depending on the operation of 30. at the end of reproduction of the desired
signals from track 31b of tape 31 a tone signal or code is reproduced by 35
which energizes a relay 39 the output of which is passed to ~~ 40 to open ~~ the
switching output of flip flop 40 to open said switch - The film 25 ~~ either ~~
continues in its motion ~~ (or is stopped until started manually)~~. The delay
relay 41 in the output of 39 permits tape 31 to continue to travel for
sufficient time for the next selection code to be picked up by lead 36 and to be
passed to shift register 37 which ~~ set ~~ actuates respective holding relays
of bank 38 which has previously been reset by the prior output of 22b. The cycle
then repeats. A reproduction control 46 connects output circuit 22W of 22a with
a controller 45 for an automatic printer - camera 44 which scans a video screen
47 which is modulated by the output of a video camera 29 the output of which is
passed to 47 when a normally open switch 42 is closed by the output of 22a. The

following signalling systems using ultrasonic ~~ singa ~~ (sound) signals have
been conceived. I. Paging or remote control system: (a) A relay transducer is
provided which becomes energized upon receipt of a sound signal of a specific
frequency or narrow frequency range. An ultrasonically vibratable transducer
provides an output signal which is amplified and used to energize a switch to
either open or close a circuit upon receipt of said signal. This may be used to
energize a ~~ relay ~~ servo, sound a buzzer, turn on a light, etc (b) The
receiver circuit may comprise a plurality of transducers each of which is
energizable to provide an output signal or JB 2/15/61 EC 2/15/61

includes means for selectively transmitting simultaneous sound signals of
different frequencies in the range of ~~ of ~~ or at specific frequencies which
will energize respective of said transducers. The outputs of the transducer for
a specific relay or receiver may be connected to a logical AND circuit so that
if all are energized at the same time, the AND relay will produce an output
which may be used to energize a servo, close or open a switch, etc for control
purposes. In this way, different arrangements of transducers responsive to
different frequencies may be used to control different devices in a given
location (a factory floor for example). The transmitter may comprise plurality
of push button switches which, when activated would, each generate an ultrasonic
signal of a different frequency. The output transmitter may also be controlled

Devices and Systems The following ultrasonic inventions have been conceived by
me. (1) Ultrasonic cleaning of clothes and other fabric materials. It is
conceived to generate supersonic waves in a chamber into which is introduced a
vapor of cleaning agent on a spray thereof in which the vapor, and/or spray and
the mechanical agitation thereof as well as the article the cleaned results in a
cleaning action. The article may be first immersed, agitated, tumbled, etc. in a
cleaning liquid and thereafter either hung or tumbled in the ~~ ultrasonic ~~
chamber in the presence of said supersonic waves which are also effective in
drying the article. {2) Utilizing ultrasonic vibrations generated in a plastic
material tube in a molten or semi-molten state to (a) increase or speed up
polymerization, (b) improve the physical and chemical characteristics of the
plastic. The ultrasonic transducer may be placed for example in the extrusion
throat of an extruder, upstream of the throat downstream or in the extrusion
die. For processes such as the spinnerette THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ &

formation of synthetic fibers, the transducer may be provided in the plastic
stream upstream of the spinnerette (spinneret) ~~ to ~~ or in the spinnerette
{spinneret) head itself to react ~~ ion ~~ on the plastic prior to or as it
exudes therefrom. (3) In dying certain fibers, yarns or cloth such as
polypropylene materials, ultrasonic vibration applied in the dying liquid to the
surface of the yarn, fiber, or cloth may be used to improve the penetration of
the dye into the yarn or fiber (4) In the penetration of matted textiles from
non-woven filaments such as polyester, nylon, polypropylene, ultrasonic
vibrations applied to the fibers which are compressed by the ultrasonic
transducer as it vibrates may be used for bonding the fibers together and/or to
a base sheet. The transducer may comprise a cylindrical roller which is power
operated and coacts with a second roller in driving the matte or fibers
therethru or a bar which ~~ raises a ~~ automatically lowers  compresses a strip
area of the matte, ultrasonically welds the fibers, then raises while the matte

Step 1 - A potential difference V is applied across the series R-C circuit
formed by the photoconductor & the insulatory layers of the tape. This potential
is applied thru an electron flood beam, Contact is maintained for a period of
time equal to many times the series R-C circuit. At the end of this period, a
uniform potential difference equal to the applied voltage V is established
across the insulator layer, The electron flood beam is turned off and the
applied voltage reduced to zero. Tape is now ready for optical exposure Step 2-

Note regarding Interference No. 91657 with Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation.
I called Mr. Mahler, patent attorney for Olin Mathieson in N.Y.C- last fall and
last January in this matter and suggested that we get together and discuss this
matter. In our conversation he asked about my other interference (91656)
involving Reynold Metals & myself and I told him I did not intend to contest the
matter with Reynolds since I know them to have been ahead of me. Now I have been
notified by the Patent Office that the interference procedure has been
terminated due to Olin Mathiesons filing under Rule 456 to drop one of their
co-inventors. I.R.E. Show - While at this show on Thursday , Mar. 23rd I talked
to a salesman of Powertron Ultrasonics Corp, Roosevelt Field, Garden City, L.I.,
N.Y. after noticing their Ultrasonic level control in action. I conceived of
this being used for liquid metal level control and discussed this with him
including the following conceived ideas which I intend to file a patent on. The
Ultrasonic probe is coupled to the exterior surface of the mold or flow chamber
into or through which liquid metal is flowed and senses the level of the liquid
metal. 4/18/61 MW

### Page 114
In this way the probe need not contact the liquid metal. The salesman said he
had not heard of such an application and that the transducer or probe was
guaranteed for operation to only 500° F. However upon questioning him, I
discovered that Powertron's transducer is a welded, not epoxy resin bonded,
assembly and that it is magnetostructrally operated. Therefore I stated that it
could be calibrated above 500° F for high temperature operation and that the
transducer and/or mold could be liquid cooled if necessary to reduce its
temperature. I told him that I would that in touch with his company regarding
this and my other near ultrasonic devices for possible licensing. I also
conceived of an application to a casting wheel where the ultrasonic transducer
is movable on an arm to contact the exterior surface of ~~ the ~~ a mold of a
plurality of wheel mounted molds at the level desired in casting to sense the
metal when it reaches said predetermined level, and provide a signal to effect
termination of metal flow by control of a servo regulating flow which transducer
then retracts off the mold permitting rotation of the wheel. The arm mounting
the transducer to be coupled to the mold is driven by a first servo means
towards and away from the mold and is prepositioned in height to account 4/18/61

for different liquid levels  of different  to be attained in different molds by
a second servo means which is programmed and operated in accordance with the
rotation of the wheel to selectively preposition said probe at different heights
for each mold to effect casting to a predetermined level in each mold. In other
words, the height posited is servo adjustable to permit the ultrasonic probe or
transducer to be prepositioned at a selected height for each mold prior to
coupling engagement with the mold. Jerome Lemelson March 24, 1961 I visited Mr

conductor materials rather than silver which is quite expensive. When they
informed me that they had not been successful with these due probably to the
oxide film which forms on the surface of the particles, I remarked that perhaps
these materials could be used if they were mixed with the plastic either
immediately after forming prior to becoming oxidized or if they were kept rom
oxidizing by forming them (by flame spraying) in an inert atmosphere free of
oxygen or oxidizing material. He, Mr. Sussman, stated that this would be a

conceived to develope an input device for obtaining information from a storage
computer over or by means of telephone lines. One application of such a device
and answerback equipment at the storage computer is to facilitate air lines, bus
or train reservations from a location remote from the storage drum or computer
where, for example, an agent currently must place a phone call to the office
containing the reservation storage device and ask a clerk there at to operate an
input device to derive information from the computer. Other applications include
any function such as banking, etc, in which stored information may be

it is presented as a display on a visual indicator 19. Fig. 2' illustrates a
possible form of the pulse train generated on the output of shift register 28.
Pulse P1 picked up by head 40Pa is a row indicating pulse and also indicates the
start of the pulse train and the fact that a flight or trip, etc. is present on
the drum. Pulses P2, P3 and P4 which immediately follow P, indicate that 3 seats
have been reserved or may indicate that only THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ &

three seats are still available. The duration of that portion of the pulse train
P1 existing between pulse P4 and the last (position indicating pulse PN may be
used as an indication of the amount or number of seats available. The indicating
means 19 contains a timing means or counter which is energized during the period
P1 appears at the input 15 but not after PN has been reproduced and employs a
conventional electro-mechanical counter indicator, which is manually resettable,
to indication the duration of P1 or number of openings or seats available in the
selected flight. In order to effect a recording indicating a reservation reserve
a seat, the operator at 10 must next effect a recording on the row of the
selected flight and on a channel thereof which will provide a pulse indicated as
next to P4 at P5 when said train is next reproduced. Recording of a pulse onto
the channel adjact that from which P4 was reproduced is effected as follows.

documents are scanned in a predetermined sequence and the video picture signals
of each are automatically recorded in place of the old picture signals.
Documents are sorted to place them in said predetermined sequence by punched
card or other techniques. Old picture signals are all erased. II. Second system
is modification of first system in which a document recording of a ~~ is er ~~
tandem or other array thereof is erased only on command, that is only ~~ when a

REFINING & UPGRADING OF METAL 1. Electron Beam Technique-a patent application
will be prepared for a method of refining metal which comprises the steps of
heating metal in an air evacuated container to a melt condition, using a first
electron beam

to traverse the melt and zone refine the metal, and using either the same
electron beam or a further beam to introduce a second material into the metal
(such as a ceramic such as AlO2, ZrO2, TiO2, etc.) either in the vaporous state
or as particles in the quantity of 1% to 10% or less which second material
eventually becomes part of the grain boundary of the metal (crystals) when the
melt solidifies and improves the crystalline structure. 2. A method of
continuously casting and (zone) refining metal is conceived in which metal is
introduced into an open ladle in a vacuum or inert atmosphere, refined by
continuous scanning with an electron beam to purge the impurities towards one
end of the ladle or the pure metal away from the impurities, the refined metal
is fed into the first opening in the ladle or container which communicates with
a vertically extending continuous casting mold and continuously cast into a long
billet (metal billet may be drawn by a conveyance such as plural power operated
wheels engaging the surface of the solidified billet). Metal containing
impurities may be continuously ~~ or inter ~~ removed from

vaporizing metal in a vacuum or controlled atmosphere, then scanning the ~~ l ~~
vapor as it is formed with one or more electron beams in a manner to cause the
pure metal constituent of the vapor to be directed by the beam along a
predetermined path or paths against a surface to form a solid of predetermined
purity. The material directed by the beam may be predetermined or varied by beam
intensity, controlling beam frequency and generation of a magnetic field of
predetermined characteristics in the volume of the vapor and beam. In this
respect, it is conceived to employ an electron beam and a controlled or
controllable intense steady or oscillating magnetic field surrounding the beam
for (a) controlling the flow of material in or into said beam, (b) seperating
materials in said beam, (c) heating material(s) in or adjacent said beam to a

(1) the hole in the bottom wall opens and (2) the powder in the general vicinity
of the opening is agitated so that a small quantity flows downward into the bore
of the barrel and/or onto a portion of the piston front face so that when the
piston moves forward and stops, the powder will be thrown off by inertia. The
powder may also be dispensed onto the missile being fired so that it trails
behind when the missile fired and is dispensed by the turbulent air behind the
missile. Or it may be depressed onto the bottom wall of the bore to be picked up
by the piston in its forward travel. Or, the operator may dispense powder onto
the missile (unto a retaining groove or shelf at the rear end of the missile,
prior to loading) Smoking toys using the above arrangements are conceived as
follows (a) A water gun which smoke, (b) A ball or bullet firing gun which
smokes (c) Cap firing gun which smoke (d) Suction cup dart gun smoke (e) Spring

FOR EXAMINING TEETH using ultrasonic energy. It is conceived to place a small
instrument or housing in the mouth of a ~~ patient ~~ patient for automatic
scanning of the teeth to replace X-ray methods. It is also conceivable that an
infra-red scanner may be employed outside of the mouth to obtain an image on the
face of a cathode ray tube (as with the ultrasonic scanner) of the teeth since
bone material (of which the teeth are made) radiates heat at a different
wavelength than skin (human). It is possible that a combination of infra-red
scanning and ultrasonics may be employed to replace X-ray. JL 2/5/63

ultrasonic inspection, water in the mouth may be employed as a coupling medium
for ultrasonic waves generated by a transducer in the mouth. The transducer and
test circuitry may be of the pulse-echo type. A small transducer placed in the
mouth may be oscillated in a rotary path in its housing or rotated while
scanning (irradiating and receiving) driven by a small motor in the housing, by
fluid pressure means, by a flexible shaft or mechanical connection therewith.
Hot water or a source of heat placed in the mouth may provide sufficient energy
to permit infra-red scanning. The resulting B-scan signals may be recorded on a
magnetic tape for playback to modulate a video storage tube or pictures may be
taken of the screen of the immediate scan. The ultrasonic or infra-red
transducer may also be manually positioned (on a handle) by the dental

photoelectric cell and control the operational circuit control and battery
components are remotely connected, potentiated in a housing and are electrically
connected to the vehicle or target object by one flexible wire and potentiating
means such as a self moving cam & brushes. The advantage here is that the
vehicle need not be weighted down with all the components. A different vehicle
target or toy may be pluggable to the photoelectric cell of the single
controller. The photoelectric device may also be in a pluggable housing so that
is easily disconnectable from the toy vehicle.

on a vehicle such as a track traveling or remote controlled car. I intend to
present the ideas on pp. 157-161 to David Wynn of EmeNee Industries in a week or
two. Jerome Lemelson Feb. 12 1963 General Electric Research Laboratory
(Schenectady, N.Y.) has just announced (p.70 Chemical week, Jan 26-63) the
development of a new lubricant additive, which, when applied to the extrusion of
aluminum, results in extruded shapes with a mirror finish. It may also be
applied to give bright finishes in processes such as die forming, roll forming,
rolling, wiredrawing, polishing, etc. The following fabricating methods ~~ emplo
~~ and articles utilizing or employing such new additive are conceived by me: 1.
A method and apparatus for extruding sheet, tubing, angles, and and other shapes
with mirror surface finishes combined with one or more of the following
processes derived by guiding the extrusion as it extrudes through one or more
stations containing apparatus set-up downstream of the extruder in line with the
extrusion die for: a) anodizing the extrusion to protect and retain the mirror
finish; CM 2/13/63 E.L. 2/20/63

### Page 158
(a) Plastic coat the outside and/or inside of the extrusion ~~ prw after or
without anodizing. The hot extrusion may be cooled by fluid means (by passing it
through a cooled liquid, blasting air thereagainst, etc) to the molten range of
the plastic (if thermoplastic) and thereafter guided through special rubber
grommets (the shape of the extrusion) provided in the side walls of bins in
which a powder of the thermoplastic plastic is fluidized which forms a coating
thereon or said plastic may be sprayed, roller coated or applied by extrusion
wrapping it ~~ a strip around the extrusion which melts on the hot metal and
later fuses forming a coating; by passing the extrusion thru grommets in the
sidewalls of a bin containing liquid plastic, by electro-statically applied
powder or spray, etc. (c) Continuously straighten the extrusion as it comes out
of the die by servo controlled stretching the extrusion so that it will not have
to be straightened after receiving a coating or anodizing (d)Process the
extrusion before it oxidizes by means such as provided on pp 69-75, p. 34
(electron beam or light beam decorative machining of the surface of the
extrusion)

CM 2/13/63 EL 2/20/63

### Page 159
(e) Operate on the extrusion as it extrudes prior to anodizing or coating with a
rotary die(s), wire brush, burring, or other (buff, etc.) means to dull or
destroy part of the mirror finish to provide designs. The design may be
determined by: (i) the shape of the tool, brush or buff operating on the surface
of the extrusion as it extrudes (ii) a mask in the form of a closed loop
stainless steel belt with cut-outs maybe driven at the speed of the extrusion
between the brush, burr, or buffing wheels and the surface to be decorated (iii)
mask in the form of plastic roller coated in patterns on the surface and
solidified or tape applied to the extrusion for protecting it from abrading
action of a wire wheel, blast of grit continuously, etching liquid sprayed,
roller applied or applied by passing the extrusion thru a bath of etchant (iv)
other means such as electron beam, laser beam, etc. used to etch selective areas
of the extrusion. (f) Apparatus may include passing the extrusion as it
extrudes, thru a pipe or housing at the die exit which has a controlled
atmosphere to prevent oxidation prior to otherwise CM 2/13/63 EL 2/20/63

### Page 160
Processing the extrusion. (g) Extruded sheet or other shape of aluminum may be
continuously formed as it extrudes with special tooling without ruining the
finish by means of rubber dies, rollers or automatic hydroforming equipment
which travels with the extrusion. Article made with GE's lubricant and additive
include (a) Dies, rollers, slide-ways, bearings, etc having the lubricant or
additive  ? impregnated into the sintering or incorporated in with the powdered
metal prior to sintering. (b) Surface coating a metal article with said
lubricant by incorporating the lubricant in with or coating particles of metal
or ceramic with the lubricant, applying them to a surface, and working them into
a solid metal (containing lubricant) coating for the surface by one of the
following: (i) shot blasted against powdered metal applied to the surface, (ii)
placement of the article to be coated into a die cavity of larger volume than
the article and containing powdered metal or other CM 2/13/63 EL 2/20/63

### Page 161
material to be coated. Compressing the article into the die (with or without
heating) and/or the powdered metal or material already in the die with cause
essentially coating or sintering said powder as a solid layer on the surface of
the article. The pressure may be such (as may temperature) as to cause the
powder to melt into a non-porous coating or to provide a porous coating with
lubricant filling the pores. J. Lemelson Caroline Murray 2/13/62 Feb. 13–1963
Continuing with the above lubricant additive and its polishing effects, the
following methods and articles have also been conceived: 2. A method for coating
an article with aluminum or other metal and creating a mirror finish on the
coating are conceived as follows: (a) Completely coat the surface of a rod or
wire, strip or sheet with metal such as aluminum. Then pass the coated piece
thru a drawing die lubricated by said G.E. additive with the diameter of the die
being slightly smaller than the diameter of the coating. In other words, the die
is not used to drawing the wire but only to smoothen the surface of the coating
and to impart final mirror finish thereto. E.L. 2/20/63 CM 2/25/63

### Page 162
otherwise, since the base were itself (if steel coated with aluminum) is not
being drawn, the coating material will only be drawn and perhaps removed from
the base. Diameter of the die will depend on such variables as uniformity of
coating, amount of surface working required to create mirror finish, etc.
Process may be continuous in which single line or pass is used to coat the wire,
draw it thru a die, then anodize or plastic coat the polished surface of the
coating. Heat of coating and/or drawing may be used to enhance or improve
anodizing or for plastic coating. Automatic temperature controls, means for
lowering or raising temperature where necessary, etc may be applied to
continuous process. Anodizing may be effected or enhanced by incorporating
anodizing chemicals in lubricant used for drawing and either connecting the die
or dies and/or other surfaces such as rollers (conducting rubber rollers)
contacting the wire as it is drawn in circuit with the necessary source of
electrical energy to effect anodizing of the polished surface of the coating.
The above procedure may be supplemented by also passing the coated and E.L

decrease in diameter by applying ultrasonic energy or electromagnetic field
which changes in characteristic at high frequency to enhance the polishing
action. An automatic control system for polishing as described is conceived in
which either the spacing of rollers or diameter of a die is varied in accordance
with feedback signals ~~ gene ~~ variations generated as a result of scanning
the thickness of the part or the finish imparted thereto. The feedback signal
may vary an electromagnetic field around the die or a serve positioning one or
both rollers. Jerome Lemelson Automatic or Programmed Planetary Mill The
following improvements in a planetary rolling mill employing either one
revolving planetary roller and a fixed die or a common (conventional) roll
cooperating with a planetary roller assembly are conceived. Ref. Fig. 1 to 3 p
169. Several improvements conceived by me include. (a) Program control
operations of the hydraulic servo 24 moving the fixed die 22 away from the
planetary work rolls 17 to vary the thickness of the piece or work W being
rolled as it is EL 2/20/63 CM 2/25/62

axis. (b) at one end of the drum is placed an ultrasonic sirene or whistle
adapted to generate intense sound waves within the drum as it rotates tumbling
the clothes (c) The ultrasonic whistle has the effect of removing the cleaning
fluid from the clothing and removing dirt therewith which has been dissolved in
said fluid. The hypersonic sound waves generated in the air/vapor surrounding
the clothes in the drum may also be operative to react with cloth or fabric of
the clothing so as to shake dirt, loosened by the cleaning fluid, off the
clothing (d) If liquid (cleaning fluid) is admitted to the drum either prior to
and/or after starting the ultrasonic sirens, the clothes which are tumbled by
being carried to the top of the drum, will fall freely thru space to be
subjected to high intensity sound waves and will thereafter fall into the liquid

reduce porosity, eliminate defects therein, etc by either intermittently
applying pressure to the upstream fluid and/or downstream fluid in the form of

as powdered ceramic, metal or slugs to be extruded is admitted to chamber volume
13 thru a valve means 17 communicating with 13 thru opening 18. After admission
of a charge, the material is compacted against the die 20 by advancing the
piston 14and heat may be applied by means of induction coil means 11 at the end
of the chamber to melt or sinter mass 19. A sub-piston valve 15 is provided in
piston 14 to permit a liquid such as liquid metal, high temp hydraulic fluid

thru die opening 20'. Notation 21 refers to a chamber downstream of the die
which may also be pressurized to support the die during extrusion. Pressure
fluctuations or shocks may be applied to the fluid in region 22 in synchronized
relation to the pressure variations applied to the fluid in region 13 to both

J.M Berliner PHOTOELECTRIC TARGET GAMES The following ideas for photoelectric
target games are conceived: I Photoelectric cell at target when energized by
light beam from gun activates a solenoid to effect (a) Pops ball or other object

Travelling down a track. Object is to hit target the instant the ball is aligned
with the solenoid. (a) Ball or other object popped up into the air may be a
reflex or retroreflector. Photoelectric cell telescope may be mounted on gun.
after causing object (ball, rocket fuel, etc.) to be ejected by light beam
action, second shot may be directed at target object popped in the air to
retroreflect light to the gun for indication of hitting flying target. (c)
Photoelectric target on a train, when hit by light beam from separate gun per se
or mounted on tower, separate train, etc. causes.(1) train to reverse,(2) alarm
to sound,(3) other action. Train travels conventional track. (d) Motorized (elec
motor driven) wheeled toy that has photocell which when energized by light beam,
causes toy to change direction, turn around, stop, pick up, swing object (arm,

direction, fire missiles, make noise, make, etc. (f) Jerome Lemelson Methods of
Making Plastic ~~ or ~~ Ceramic or Metal Matte, Wool, or Mesh. I. It is
conceived to extrude a plurality of filaments of plastic, metal, glass or
ceramic from a multitude of small holes in an extrusion die and to operate on
said filaments in one or more of several ways before or immediately after they
have solidified to automatically produce a matte, wool, mesh, or the like of the
material extruded, viz. (a) Extrusion head is rotated, as the filaments are
extruded downward, in such a manner to cause the filaments to form a wirey mass
of curled filaments. A belt conveyor moving beneath the rotating head (which may
also be otherwise moved per se or in cooperation with rotation such as back &
forth across the conveyor) received the falling mass of filaments per se or
after the have passed through water. (Conveyor may be under water). If they fall
onto conveyor, they may be immediately 3/13/63 CM EL 3/22/63

### Page 217
passed between rollers to compress them as predetermined density and provide a
web (as well as weld filaments) of predetermined thickness. Or rollers may be
heated or energized by induction energy to weld filaments together. If filaments
are metal, they may be resistance welded together where they intersect by
compression between roller electrodes or platens. A reinforced metal sheet may
be produced by fabricating or otherwise providing a first web or sheet
compressing a first matte of filaments or expanded metal of a first sheet and
continuously depositing thereon just as the first web or sheet enters rolling
dies, powdered metal (such as aluminum) or particles (rods, chips, etc) of
aluminum. Which is heated and compressed to fill the voids in the first web.
Induction energy may be applied to the rollers or other dies thru which the
sheet is driven to melt or make plastic or sinter, or molecularly bond the
aluminum particles within the voids of the sheet of web to form a solid sheet of
the two metals. CM 3/13/65 EL 3/22/63

Fluid Processing Apparatus to make metal powd, rods, etc. rotate ejector Also,
an intense magnetic field applied to the rollers or dies thru which the sheet is
driven may be used to shape, deform or compress the sheet. It is also conceived
to coat, plate or cause particles of a first material such as ceramic to become
embedded in or bonded to a second material such as aluminum, steel, etc. by
applying an intense magnetic field to a die, roller, or tooling molding on the
outer faces of two sheets to compress them together while at ambient or elevated
temperature. Jerome Lemelson Dow Corning Print Dough On March 11, 1963 I talked
with William Rossiter of Dow Corning about their Print Dough. I told him I had
applied for a patent on same. He asked me the scope of the claims (what I was
claiming) and I informed him the process itself (silicone putty & coated paper).
He asked how long ago I had made the invention and I informed him about 3 years.

to the base 16. Conductive rubber 13 is bonded to 12 with silicone adhesive.
Interface 17 comprises the siliconed adhesive which insulates conductive rubber

exhibiting resistance heating characteristics is conceived. The filaments may
have following structures. Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Fig. 4. In Fig. 2, the entire filament
20 is made of electrically conductive, ~~ heat ~~ resistance heating, rubber or
plastic. In Fig.3, the core 21 of filamnet 22 is made of said conductive rubber

teflon, or other resins, glass fibers, coated glass filaments or yarn (woven or
non woven) and coated with a flexible electrically conductive resistence heating
rubber or plastic having the necessary electrical connectors attached thereto
such as grommets, wires, ~~ri ~~rivets, etc. Such rubber in sheet form may also
be bonded to the cloth or may be applied by roller, spray or dep coating. 4.

of  re  standing up to the temperatures at which the conductive rubble layer 32
operates. The structure 30 may be used to heat a house wall, or a street or
sidewalk to melt snow and ice. The entire structure may be fabricated by
spraying on conductive layer 32, emulating rubber or flexible plastic (or
asphalt) coating 33, as well as an insulating layer or base of rubber or latex
filled asphalt between layer 31 and 32 (reverse order) if necessary. In a
special application of the structure illustrated in Fig. 5, the base 31 may
comprise a wall of a room with conductive layer 32 on the inside thereof. Base
31 may also comprise a sheet of plastic or rubber (nonconducting) and may be
used as a curtain, blanket, etc. The surface of 32 of 32 or surface 33 of 33 may

of fiberous material such as a rug, etc. bonded or otherwise required thereto.
The base 31 may also comprise a shaped sheet of metal such as a refrigerator
wall or box (for defrosting), an airplane wing panel, (for deicing) a rod or
tube (for jacketing capable of heating the tube from the outside, or inside
coating capable of heating the inside of the tube or pipe. A non-conducting
plastic, rubber, or ceramic would be provided at the interface 31'. The
structure 30 may be used in the fabrication of inflated domes and housings for
dwellings and shelters whereby the conducting layer 32 extends as bands, strips,

decorations will be registered with the dies and the  articles  will have so
vacuum formed will have registered decorations thereon. (d)and thereafter
automatically die-cutting the resulting articles from the sheet from which they
are formed by means of a rotary or flying die cutting means. The above process
may be subject to a number of variations CM 3/26/6 EL 3/22/63

including: (1)Extruding the original sheet of plastic with portions of the sheet
which are to be drawn into the molds having increased cross section (by means
such as developed in my patent & application for Extrusion Apparatus) (2)

containers on a continuous basis immediately after they are vacuum drawn into

dies. (4) The technique may be described may employ conventional extrusion
means, calendering means or means employing powdered polyethylene to form a
sheet per my prior disclosures. In other words, the sheet of plaster may be
extruded on to a stainless steel sheet belt and fed to a closed loop array of
molds, or formed on a drum or between drums and fed to vacuum drawing molds
attached to a second drum. (5) If conventional rotary printing press means is
employed to decorate the sheet, the sheet may be backed by the slainl drum
against which it is fed or the stainless steel sheet belt during printing and
while in either a semi-molten or rigid state. If in a rigid state, the sheet may
be heated to semi-molten condition thereafter prior to vacuum drawing. (6) If
electrostatic printing means (such as Xerox or other means previously disclosed
by me) are employed, it may be utilized in a position immediatly  in front of

mold (such as a vacuum forming, rotational, slush, etc) or other form of mold is
surface decorated with particles of plastic or other colorant material (inks,
paint,  etc) by metal, etc) by electrostatic printing means employing light
patterns, charge patterns developed thereby, etc. The particles may be powdered

areas of the mold. They may also be particles or spray of sheet on a material to
impart other characteristics to selected areas of the mold article molded in the
mold such as (a) conducting material (electrical resistive or otherwise), such
as copper powder or other), (b) solid film lubricant, (c) other metals, (d)
ceramic, (e) plastic with properties(strength, etc), other than that molded.

OPTICAL SCANNER— Reference is made to my previous disclosure for an optical
(electro-) scanning system employing a rotating disc having openings or maskfree
areas approximately the smape of the type being scanned. It is conceived to
provide the scanning disc with a thin film of CM 3/26/63 EL 3/30/63

electroluminescent material or thermo-plastic (TPR(G Electric) material and
including means for retaining images and means for beam scanning or otherwise
applying images to the disc such as images (clear ~~ or ~~ light transmitting
areas or areas free of deflection ripple patterns or light blocking areas) with
input means for generating a particular alpha-numeric type font (size and style)
on an annular band area of the disc for electro-optical scanning and comparison
as described. Thus, either under human or automatic means for detecting the type
being seamed, the comparator image areas on the disc may be charged to match the
type being scanned without charging discs or mask plates. Jerome Lemelson
PLASTIC FABRICATION PROCESSES & APPARATUS The following processes involve the
continuous extrusion of the thermoplastic materials such as polyethylene,
polypropylene, etc. into plastic sheet or film and its continuous vacuum drawing
into molds or containers for the purposes of (a) forming articles such CM
3/26/63 EL 3/30/63

### Page 236
as plastic bottles or tubes, (c) lining containers such as drums, cans, bottles,
paper, ~~or ~~corrugated or paperboard boxes. Methods & Apparatus include: I.
Continuously extrude or calender thermoplastic sheet, feed over or adjacent open
containers such as drums, boxes, cans, etc., clampingly engage the sheet against
the rim of the container and apply vacuum to the inside of the container (and/or
pressure above the sheet) while the sheet is semi-molten as the plastic sheet
being extruded and/or post heated, to draw the sheet into the container to form
a plastic liner, therefore which conforms to the shape of the container.
Containers are continuously fed on top of a belt conveyor or with the upper rim
of the container held by clamping means at the level of a belt or flight
conveyor parallel to the soft or semi-molten plastic sheet. Clamping of the
sheet against the rim may be effected by a second closed loop belt conveyor
disposed above the conveyor carrying the containers and above the sheet, or by a
flight of a closed loop flight conveyor. Vacuum may be applied to the inside of
each container to effect drawing the semi-molten sheet or film into the
container in one of several manners: viz(next page) CM 3/26/63 EL 3/30/63

### Page 237
(a) The container may be open at its lower end (i.e a bottomless can resting on
a conveyor flight which is later capped) (b) a small opening may be provided in
the lower end to which a conduit is attached  for applying vacuum. (c) the
bottom of the container may be porous or contain natural openings (i.e. folded
paper board carton, etc.) opening b) may be automatically closed off after so
leaving the containers. The left ( closed loop belt conveyor) on which the
container bottoms ride may be porous or made of screening capable of passing
air.  A plenum chamber from which air is constantly being withdrawn may be
placed beneath this belt in the vicinity of the location where the semi-molten
plastic sheet is drawn of the top of the container and the sheet will
automatically be drawn into the container when air i automatically drawn into
the plenum chamber through the belt from the inside of the container. An
apparatus is conceived in which the belt or flight conveyor carrying the
containers and (fired) the closed loop conveyr used to engage the plastic sheet
against the top of each container are adjustably movable away from each other to
accommodate containers of different heights. A method is also conceived CM
3/26/63 EL 3/30/63

### Page 238
in which the plastic sheet is not clampingly engaged against the open rims of
the containers but is merely brought thereagainst and drawn into the containers
by atmospheric pressure when vacuum is applied to the interior of the container.
Thus, additional plastic material from the surrounding sheet may be flowed into
the container (or mold) from the surrounding sheet of plastic and deeper draws
are possible without drawing the sheet to thin. For containers which do not have
bottom openings, air may be evacuated therefrom by the (automatic) insertion of
an open ended tube along the inside wall of the container from the open top
thereof to which tube vacuum is applied at the correct instant. After drawing
the plastic sheet to conform to the shape of the inside wall surface (and around
the then ~~ too ~~ tube, the tube is removed. A tool on pressure applied to the
container from the open end may be used to deform the plastic which conformed to
the tube shape or, the filling of the container thereafter with a product may
suffice to conform the lining to the wall, especially if the lining plastic is
flexible or thin. It is briefly noted that cap clamp CM 3/26/63 EL 3/30/63

### Page 239
a closure applied to the top of the container just prior to vacuum drawing may
be applied over the plastic sheet to dampingly engage it against the rim of the
container in place of the closed loop conveyor belt. These actions may all be

the drum rotates across the open ends of the molds M4. A radiant heater 16 may
be disposed off CM 3/28/63 EL 3/30/63

closures before heat sealing or otherwise applying to the top of the molded
containers. At the locations of molds M4 or M5 in Fig. 1, automatic apparatus
may be provided for removing the molded containers from the molds. Holding
Aluminum or other metals Following methods are conceived. (1) Hollow bodies of
aluminum may be molded by disposing aluminum powder in a mold and either heating
the wall of the molds to or above the melting temperature of the aluminum as the
mold is rotated to cause the flow of aluminum onto the walls of the mold after
which the temperature is droped to solidify the molding (2) Process of (1) may

March 30-1963 PATENT APPLICATIONS Since my gastro-intestinal operation on
September 30, 1963. I have had little opportunity to continue work on the new
patent applications which I had been working on due to incapacitation, necessary
work on amendments, appeals, petitions, etc The following are a few of the
applications I will renew my work on. (Note - Sept 30-Dec 31, 1962 I was able to
perform little if any work due to total incapacitation. Jan. 1963, I was on a
recouperative vacation. Feb. and March 1963 were spent on amendments, appeals
and C.I.P. applications necessitated by the issuance or abandonment of other
applications) I. ELECTRON BEAM DEVICES & METHODS I propose to use electron beam
devices (part of applications which I am preparing) to deposit, diffuse, plate
or otherwise dispose one material or materials into or onto another material for
forming new compounds, doping (semi-conductor) compounds, growing crystals,
welding, plating, etc; machining, creating chemical reactions, etc; testing
materials (analyzing contents, etc. Following are improvements conceived over
the past 6 months or more: 7. A Hand Tool including an electron beam gun is
conceived having an aperture applicable to EJ 4/2/63

Sam Weiner a workpiece to define a closed chamber with the work piece. An
electron-beam generated within the chamber is directed thru the aperture against
the surface of the workpiece to perform one or more of a number of functions,
vz. (a) Analysis of the material composition of the surface layer of the
workpiece and/or x-ray analysis of the structure of the workpiece both occurring
either simultaneously when a (trigger) switch is closed, or selectively. Fig.1
In Fig.1 is shown a portable electron-beam device 10 comprising ~~ an ~~ housing
12 having an aperture 13 applicable to a workpiece and electron-beam gun 16
mounted within said housing. The forward end of the housing 12 has an enlarged
rim 12' provided with an annular sealing ring 12S for abutting the surface of a
workpiece to seal the EL 4/2/63 CM 4/28/63

### Page 251
volume 17 within the housing against the workpiece. An electron beam gun or
x-ray generating unit 16 mounted within housing 12 and adapted, when energized,
to direct its beam 18 thru the aperture against the surface of the workpiece W
when an electric switch 15 is actuated when a trigger 16 thereof is pulled. The
switch 15 is monostable and is located ~~ near ~~ in the pistol grip portion 14
of the gun device 10. An opening 19 is provided thru the rim portion 12' of the
gun thru which air and/or a sampling of material vaporized from the surface of W
may be drawn. If the beam of the gun is to be generated in a vacuum, air may be
removed thru 19 and flexible line 20 connected to a vacuum pump. Notation 21
refers to a probe in the form of a scanner or sampling head adapted to analyze
the surface of W or the immediate volume surounding that area of the surface
intersected by the electron beam or x-ray beam. The end 21' of the probe 21 is
thus positioned immediately adjacent the spot area intersected by the beam 18.
The probe 21 may be operative to either electro-optically scan the area of W
intersected by the beam and/or withdraw vaporized molecules from the volume
adjacent said area for analysis by other means thru line 23. The ~~O ~~ device
10 may operate whereby, when the switch 15 is closed a controller such as a
multi-circuit timer or the like, EL 4/2/63

operation of pump on line 23 for withdrawing ~~ vapor ~~ predetermined quantity
of vapor from probe 21 and/or operation of electro-optical (infrared, electron
beam, or passive photoelectric cell, etc) transducer on the end of 21 to scan
and analyze the material of which W is composed and/or to scan & determine the
internal structure of W. In other words, probe 21 may also be an x-ray,
infra-red or other form of analyzing detector. The controller may also be
operative to effect release of the vacuum in the chamber 17 as part of the
inspection cycle or a further switch ~~ or valve ~~ may be utilized which opens
a valve. OTHER ELECTRON BEAM METHODS & Apparatus II. Electron-beam (or Laser
Beam of Light) generated in a spray of droplets or powder directed along the
beam against a workpiece in which the heat and/or energy of the beam is used to
(a) diffuse the sprayed particles or droplet material into the workpiece, (b)
plate the surface, (c) clean the surface (d) etch the surface by combined beam
and chemical milling or electrolyte actors, (e) weld the surfaces using material
of the spray as a welding component EL 4/2/63 4/28/63 CM

the particles in the stream of particles and the surface being coated, either or
both to a semi-molten state. so that ~~ heat ~~ high temperature coating may be
selectively effected onto selected areas and for selected depths, ~~ (k) ~~ etc.
III Chemical processes involving any of II (a) to (g) above may also be effected
by an electron and/or intense light beams, working seperately or in coaction
with each other. For example: (a) Two or more materials provided as streams or
sprays (or combinations of streams and sprays) may be mixed as a single stream
or intersected and may comprise powder, droplets, liquid streams, vapor streams
or combinations of any of these and may be directed thru or along an electron
beam and/or a laser beam for raising the temperature of the streams for creating
chemical reactions prior to deposition thereof and/or after deposition on a
solid surface or into a liquid stream or EJ 4/2/63

container. (b) An electron beam(s) (and/or laser light beam(s) may be used to
heat a liquid to generate steam or other vapor in a container and may also be
directed against the vapor to further raise its temperature and to direct said
vapor per se or in coaction with a second beam or jet of a second or the same
fluid generated by a pump. Electro magnetic means may be employed to direct said
vapor in a predetermined path away from the liquid particularly if the liquid is
ionized by the beam (to form a plasma). (c) A deflection controlled electron or
light beam may be operated to cause circulation or movement of a liquid or gas
along a predetermined ~~ by ~~ path by creating temperature differentials in the
liquid, gas or container therefore The beam may thus be also used as an inducer
of flow or pump and may be directed (focused) thru a transparent portion of the
wall of a container (d) An electron beam or intense light beam may be used to
generate electricity in a closed container for operating a pump therein or other
electrical device such as a transducer. The beam EJ 4/2/63 CM 4/28/63

window (quartz) into the container at a thermoelectric generator active element
for powering a motor, radio transmitter, transducer, such as a temperature,
pressure, or other sensitive device for measuring a reaction, or other
variables. The same beam may also be used in the process for heating,
vaporizing, etc. to create a reaction. (c) A thermoelectric generator mounted in
a furnace or other reaction chamber utilizing heat may be energized for
generating electricity for powering one or more measuring devices and a radio
transmitter adapted to transmit code or analog signals of the variables
measured, by the heat of reaction or the furnace heat. (e) Combined Electron
and/or Laser Generated Light Beams. (1) Beam(s) plus electrical current to weld
or machiine. Current applied between elctrodes as in resistence welding. Beam(s)
directed at the weld area to hasten welding, deposit material, inspect (X-ray)
as weld is made (to provide feed-back signal controlling welding, etc. Part or
parts rotated in path of beam and/or translated under numerical or other form EL

Method and Apparatus for Continuously Producing Honeycomb on Waffle Sheering

Fig 1. In Fig. 1, metal powder or pellets 9 are discharged at a predetermined
rate from a hopper. Heated pellets of aluminium or other metal flow from the
hopper between two power driven drums 12 and 14, the exterior surfaces of each
of which are shaped with a plurality of projections or teeth disposed along the
length of each drum and adapted to fall between the side walls of the tooth-like
formations of the other drum (stations 13 and 16). The teeth do not mesh but
provide volumes 17 between the walls of each (see Fig. 2) which define the wall
thickness and shape of the resulting honeycomb cell or waffle-like sheet
structure.

Methods and Apparatus for Identifying Articles Vehicles, Tokens and People
Automatically. A number of systems for identifying objects automatically have
been conceived. The following are general descriptions which will be expanded or
further described and developed. I. A card or flat token, preferably rectangular
in shape and dimensioned between one and two inches along ~~ a ~~each side. The
token contains a plurality of discrete value areas with indicia or other forms
of recordings, each of which value area when scanned and/or cancelled is the
equivalent in money expended ~~ of ~~ and represents payment by the user for
obtaining a particular product, monetary value in products, or service. For
example, the card or token may have 20 or 30 discrete areas each having a
predetermined location ~~ wl ~~and each when CM 3/6/63

scanned and/or cancelled by puncture or other means upon insertion into a
scanning device or machine, represents payment of a particular sum of money
towards, for example, payment of a train fare, road toll, admission to a

commutation ticket ~~ for ~~good for 30 round trips on a vehicle such as a
train, bus, boat, or airplane and, as such would contain 60 discrete areas to be
scanned and/or cancelled by machine which upon positive identification of the
card and the uncancelled area thereof would result in opening a gate; unlocking
of a turnstile, release of a product, etc from a storage location etc. The card
may also contain recorded or shape means (edge notching) for identifying the
owner, date of purchase, etc. which may also be automatically scanned CM 3/6/63

metal spinning have been conceived. I. A method of spin forming a sheet or tube
of metal (or plastic or ceramic) comprising ~~ plac ~~ spin forming the metal to
a first shape in a lathe type fixture and thereafter drawing the metal while
spinning. Drawing may be effected by means of (a) moving a mandrel
longitudinally and axially against the spinning sheet after or during spin
forming or (b) in the case of a tube being spun to shape while the ends of the
tube are held in respective rotating chucks or fixtures, by power driving said
chucks or fixtures apart, preferably while a tool is depressed against the
surface of the spinning tube as to permit the metal EL 4/18/63

### Page 46
spin together to close & pour in metal onto plug

to draw out. Control of the movement and force exerted by the chucks in movement
away from each other as well as the force, location, and movement (radially as
well as longitudinally) of the tool or tools depressed against the tubing as it
spins, may be automatic in accordance with a program or other means. Control may
also be effected by means of feedback signals compared with recorded reference
signals and derived by optically or otherwise measuring the diameter of the
spinning part at the tool, the wall thinness thereof, the forces applied to the
tool, etc. II Form an article such as a drinking cup, pitcher, etc. by spinning
a length of tubing and reducing a portion of its length with a EL 4/18/63

plug or rod disposed within the tubing whereby the spinning causes the wall of
the tubing to be deformed against (and possibly spin welded) against the plug or
rod. Champaign glasses forming of metal effects may be so derived in metal

other material) to atomize or vaporize). (a) employing a rapidly expanding and
collapsing internal magnetic filed in the vicinity (around the end of the
melting rod or billet to cause the melted material to ~~ at ~~ form tiny

droplets away from the end. (c) magnetostrictively vibrating the rod or
continuous casting by coupling it to a source of magnetostrictive energy. (d)
Moving the end of the melting rod (just above the melted portion) against a
vibrating member such as a transducer. (e) striking the melting metal with a
pulsed light beam or an electron beam of sufficient energy to cause the metal
melting to atomize or vaporize. Methods and Apparatus For Continuously Extruding
Metal. The following steps are involved (Process#1) (a) Continuously form
pellets of metal such as aluminum (for example, by Reynold's metals technique of
pouring aluminum into a rapidly CM 4/28/63

### Page 57
rotating drum (e) The pelets are then screened, and reheated to a temperature
near the molten range of the metal - Thereafter, one or more of several
techniques may be employed to continuously extrude the pellets to a
predetermined shape. viz. I Pellets are fed to an extrusion screw at a flow rate
sufficient to permit said screw to force the pellets thru a die to form an
extrusion thereof Pellets may be heated in the extrude to a semi-molten state to
facilitate extrusion. Cut-off of lengths of the extrusion is on-the-fly. Screw
may reciprocate as it rotates to compact the pellets into a solid metal mass in
advance of the die. Employment of an intense expanding and collapsing magnetic
filed around in in the extrusion EL 4/23/63 CM 4/28/63

chamber may also solidify and densify the pellets into a solid extrudable mass.
II Pellets are fed to an extrusion chamber and are forced thru a die opening in
said chamber by a ram or piston. Piston advances toward die and retracts after
full forward motion permitting new charge of (heated) pellets - to enter
extrusion chamber in advance of ~~ it ~~ piston. Process repeats. Induction
energy applied to chamber and/or die heats charge and/or maintains temperature
of the end of ~~ the process ~~ what is left of the prior charge so that new
slug formed by a new charge unites with the remaining portion of the old charge
or slug. to form a single extrusion. Die may also be heated. CM 4/28/63

### Page 58
III Pellets are alternately charged first into one extrusion chamber (while the
other is extruding metal) then into the other. A valving means between the two
alternately feeds metal first from one and the other chamber to the die (and/or
~~ the ~~ a third chamber immediately in front of the die. Valving means may
comprise a rotating die plate. IV Pellets are fed downward between rollers which
are shaped to both roll and extrude the metal into various structural shapes
such as beams, channels, tubing, etc. Other rollers may be employed to further
shape the metal formed in the first rollers. V Pellets are automatically EL
4/23/63 CM 4/28/63

formed and fed to a plurality of impact extrusion dies. More than enough metal
is employed and excess metal is forced out of the die and recycled. VI A new
method and apparatus for forming metal sheet (such as aluminum) is conceived as
follows: (A.) Aluminum in molten state is poured at a predetermined rate ~~ to
~~ onto a ~~ rapidly ~~ moving closed loop belt (the upper surface thereof) such
as a sheet of stainless ~~ stea ~~ steel and retained on the belt by bowing the
belt downward in the center viz

(B) As the belt moves along, ~~ the bow ~~ horizontally, the bow gradually
    decreases (by roller means guiding the belt, the metal spreads out thereon
    and solidifies as it cools. Cool air or other fluid is 4/28/63 CM

### Page 59
directed against the underface of the belt to increase solidifying rate. The
metal may then be stripped off the belt and used per se or may be passed
therefrom or therewith thru rolls of a rolling mill to roll it to size. The same
technique may be employed to form plastic sheet from molten plastic or powdered
plastic introduced onto a heated (and later cooled) belt. The moving  (and
cooled) belt apparatus may be used to convey liquid metal from a furnace to
other casting or forming means.

(adjustable vent) Dan Wyn (flasher & flash lite phone) Dust Cloth A model of my
vacuum dust cloth was completed on May. 6, 1963 and worked successfully (i.e.
was successful in picking up dust and face powder from surfaces) The model
consisted of a sheet of open cell urethane foam folded on itself with a Vexar
extruded netting sleeve inserted therebetween to maintain the foamed cellular
plastic portions apart - A vacuum cleaner head inserted at one end & connected
to a vacuum cleaner hose draw air thru the sponge or cellular cloth which picked
up dust. This was disclosed (drawings) to Al Landes and Marvin , on May 6, 1963

PACKAGING MATERIALS The following packaging materials are conceived. (enlarged
several times or more)

FIG. 1 11 may be paperboard, corrugated cardboard, rigid plastic, foamed plastic
etc The packaging material 10 comprises a lamination of a base sheet 11 of paper
board, plastic or other suitable material which comprises the major thickness of
the p material 10. Coating one surface 13 of sheet 11 is a film 14 of heat
sealable plastic such as a polyvinyl chloride (Videne A) which may be extrusion
coated thereon. Laminated to film 14 and secured thereto by heat sealing is a
second film 15 of plastic sheeting material portions 15' of which stand off and
away from the coated surface 13 of sheet 11 to provide a quilt-like E.L. 5/13/63

(b) Sheet 15 may be passed through embossing rolls just prior to (or as)
application thereof to the base sheet 11 which embossing roll(s) may be
operative to shape the sheet # ~~as it ~~ 11 as illustrated by the pressure of
the surface of the roll itself. If the embossing roll is properly heated, it may
shape 15 in a quilt-like pattern by engaging the sheet against a soft rubber
roll by means of said heated embossing roll without fluid vacuum or pressure.
(c) Sheet 15 may be vacuum formed to retain portions 15' away from the base 11
after 15 is laminated and spot or line welded to 11. In other words, 15 may be
drawn off the surface of 11 or 14 after being welded thereto, by passage between
rollers one of which contains vacuum forming means. (d) A continuous process for
forming sheet material 10 is conceived as follows: (a) Continuously extrude film
or sheet plastic 15, and guide in a predetermined path (b) continuously feed
sheet 11 from a supply thereof, (c) continuously feed extruded sheet 15 in a
semi-molten state between a drum and the surface 13 of 11, the drum being shaped
as a rotary die with ridges adapted to compress

14 not present) and to bond portions 15W to the surface 13 due to the adhesive
characteristics of the semi-molten material comprising 15. Film portions 15'
between portions 15W may be caused to outwardly bulge by vacuum applied to the
areas of the drum between the die ridges or the warpage of 15. If sheet 15 is a
sheet of self foaming (polystyrene, etc) cellular plastic which is in the act of
foaming as it is extruded, the volume 17 may be filled with foamed plastic such
a cellular polystyrene, urethane, etc and the contour defined by surface 14' may
be derived without the need to vacuum or pressure form 15. If sheet 11 is porous
or has die punched holes through and through, positive pressure applied to the
volume beyond surface 12 may be used to outwardly bulge sheet 15 as the
lamination 10 is fed and after bonding of areas 15W to 11 (welding) has been
effected. (e) Sheet 11 may have a quilted plastic film such as 15 also bonded to
its other surface 12 to provide both faces so textured. Either or both sheets of
covering plastic may be heat sealable so that sections of material 10 may be
heat sealed or welded together. (f) sheet 11 may comprise flexible or

providing a wiping action and for storing liquid or detergent to be used in
cleaning. If the material of which 10 is made is flexible, scouring action may
be derived by mixing scouring filament, grit, etc with the extruding material
prior to extrusion or rolling these into the sheet 10 after it extrudes. Jerome

### Page 22
Cornish Nestles - Radio & flashlite be desired to utilize a videotape recorder
as an elapsed time interval recorder to scan and record image signals at
predetermined time intervals (i.e. 1 to 5 seconds or more) of events which may

polyethylene (high density), polypropylene, vinyl, etc. A sponge-like plastic
such as cellular vinyl, urethane, etc may be extruded onto tube, the tube
recording screen is automatically erased, and the next scan (by the same or a
different video camera) is effected to provide a second image recording on the
video storage tube which recording is scanned to repeat the cycle. Said
recording onto the storage tube may be automatically controlled by timer or the
signal generated which the read beam ends the transducing of the last signal
recorded thereon. Or recording may be controlled by a detector such as a means
for detecting a certain change in an image field (i.e. the movement of part of
the image, appearance of a person, vehicle, etc. change in a random image etc.)
which generates a signal used for control. Multiplexing or gating of video
picture signals from different cameras to a single recorder may also be
automatically effected or programmed. Jerome Lemelson May 16, 1963 VENDING
MACHINE A vending machine is conceived which will also fill and freeze EL

pouches, of plastic film with a liquid to provide frozen ice pops, cubes, or
other shapes of ice and the like for coin operated sales: General Description of
Machine & Operation 1. One or more roles of plastic film are provided in the
machine for dispensing a heat sealed strip of connected oblong plastic pouches
which extend laterally across the strip coming from the roll 2. Motor driven
guide and driven means engage the plastic pouch strip and feed it past a filling
device which contains an injector needle which injects a predetermined quantity
of liquid to be frozen into each pouch as it passes the filling station. A heat
sealing machine (optional) seals the hole created by the needle of the filling
injector 3. The still connected filled pouch is next driven through a freezing
chamber preferably containing thermoelectric freezing elements in which it may
be detained until ready to be dispensed. W 4. Upon insertion of a coin into the
machine and operation of a flavor selector, the end (filled and frozen) pouch of
the strip of pouches is

EL 5/23/63

### Page 25
severed from the strip by means of a cutting knife operated by a solenoid and
drops by gravity down a dispensing chute. Features and advantages of the machine
include: A. By providing concentrated sugar- flavor liquid or tablet mixes which
are automatically dispensed into a reservoir to provide a quantity of the liquid
(fruit-bar) to be frozen, the need for supplying large quantities of the liquid
product is eliminated - the machine merely need be connected to a water supply
and provided with automatic valves and controls to effect mixing of the
concentrated fruit or sugar juice prior to filling pouches therewith B. Use of
flat pouches in roll strip form ~~ permit ~~ plus liquid or powder concentrate
provides a large stock of the product to greatly increase the time between
machine filling. C. If the pouches are each pre-charged or contain ~~ powder ~~
small quantities of powder or liquid juice or sugar flavored mixture in
concentrated form, then it will only be necessary to inject water into each
pouch and agitate prior freezing.

EL 5/23/63

### Page 26
D. If it is desired to dispense connected, pre-filled pouches of juice bars
which are frozen in the machine, then the filled pouches may be guided and
driven by engagement of flat border strips at each end of the pouch
(longitudinal borders of the pouch strip) preferably containing a hole on each
border strip aligned with each pouch for sprocket drive thereof. The pouch strip
may be stored in a convoluting manner in a path thru which the strip will
automatically feed when first loaded after the strip is started by the service
man. Self threading strip may also apply to unfilled strip. (E) A BLOWER blowing
air thru the refrigerating zone may be used to cool the rest of the chamber
containing filled but not frozen pouches. (F) Control of filling may be effect
automatically by a counter whereby a batch or number of pouches are filled at a
time. Thus the end of the unfilled strip of pouches may be severed from a
predetermined number of filled pouches which are selectively dispensed
thereafter (G) Such a machine as described EL 5/23/63

### Page 27
may be incorporated within a conventional ice dispensing machine for dispensing
ice or ice pops or in a milk machine. (H) With the proper agitator and liquid
mixture, the machine may be used to fabricate pouches containing sherbets also.
(I) Pouches may be fabricated from film rolls (in the machine) or from apparatus
for extruding film or pouches. (J) The pouches may be filled with water which is
frozen to produce ice for dispensary in cube form. The ice may also be chipped
or crushed as it is prefrozen  and filled as such in the pouches which are
folded or heat sealed thereafter. (K) Crushed fruit, frozen vegetables, frozen
soups, desserts, etc. may be similarly dispensed as above from either strips of
pre-filled pouches (which are pre-frozen or frozen in the vending machine) or
are filled in the vending machine from reservoirs of said materials best at
frozen temperature. The advantages of loading in the vending machine include (a)
less time required to load

service man or automatically punctured ~~ wh ~~ by the machine apparatus when
the contents are needed for dispensing. A number of said reservoir drums or cans
may be provided in one dispensing machine. Jerome Lemelson WORD TYPEWRITER A

SCANNING SYSTEM It is conceived to effect more efficient transmission of
facsimile information over telephone lines as follows: (a) Utilize a dual system
of scanning rate. Control to scan a particular image field, that is provide a
first osculator system at both sender and receiver to which is operative to
drive both the read-beam of the video camera at the sending station and the
write beam of the video receiver at the sending station at a first speed and a
second oscillator a beam sweep speed control means at both sending and receiving
stations which is operative to drive the beams at a much higher speed. (b)
Automatically sense by scanning or other means the presence of an area lens in
the path of the picture or image field scanning beam of the camera prior to
arrival of said image field scanning beam threat. The area so sensed may be any
image intensity which is other than a white or redundant background and may be
sensed by a second beam or the leading edge of the scanning beam. sensing WW
7/20/63

### Page 104
may be effected by clipping the picture signal generated by the scanning beam
above or below a certain intensity, (frequency or amplitude)level and generating
a signal therefrom which is utilized to switch the output of the slow or fast
rate oscillator to control the beam sweep speed both at the sending and
receiving stations. In other words, both read and write beams are caused to scan
slow (or at conventional 30 frame/second speed) ~~ which ~~while scanning image
information which is not ~~ no ~~of predetermined intensity such as either white
or black background images, and are caused to scan faster (perhaps several times
30 frames/sec. speed or more) while scannning redundant field information (white
or black background)which field intensity is ~~ab~~ automatically genterated at
the receiver by automatic means if necessary. When the sensing beam no longer
senses an image area of a predetermined intensity or intensity range the lack of
an output signal therefrom is utilized to gate( by use of a monostable switch in
the output of the fast rate oscillator circuit driving the beam)the output of
the ~~ slow~~fast rate of oscillator to drive ~~the ~~ both beams at said EJW

faster rate. The sensing signal is thus not only generated at the scanning
camera and used to control the speed of the read beam thereof but is also
transmitted to the receiver station and used to and control the speed of
write-beam of the video picture tube (image tube) thereat so that the position
of both beams will always be in synchronized relationship to each other
regardless of how the read beam is speeded up or slowed down during scanning a
particular field - In other words the sensing signal is used to sync the
position and speed of sweep of the write beam with that of the read beam as well
as to effect control of the speed or rate of scanning of the two beams. It is
noted that the two oscillator systems must be synced to each other with the fast
sweep oscillator control generating line vertical sync signals at a frequency
which is a multiple of the frequency of that in which the slow rate oscillator
operates or the operation may be such that the fast sweep oscillator is only
operative to control the speed of the beam sweep and not line frequency which is
controlled either by a separate oscillator or the slow sweep oscillator
circuits. If the image field contains a line image of a particular intensity
along, for example, the right hand border, EW 7/20/63

to sync same to the operation of both.

15, 1963 Apparatus and Method for Continuously casting (or extruding) metal and
continuously coating or treating the shape so cast or extruded as it experiences
from the mold or die. viz. I. Continuously cast or extrude hollow shapes such as
pipe and introduce the coating material as a liquid or powder through the
mandrel (and/or an extension thereof extending some distance into the interior
of the shape being cast or extruded) in a manner to cause said material to form
the desired coating on the inside surface of the pipe. Note: the mandrel or a
portion thereof, determines the shape of the interior of the casting. Depending
also after it is drawn on the characteristics of the coating material and how it
is conveyed to the exhaust end of the mandrel, the interior of the mandrel may
have to contain jacketing or conduit means for moving a heat transfer fluid
therethru to prevent volatizing or burning said coating LW 9/8/63 JC - 8/16/63

(coat outside) Material. The continuous casting die or mold may also have to be
water cooled (if casting or extruding steel or other metal which will otherwise
be at a temperature so high when it passes the end of the mandrel or extension
thereof thru which coating material is introduced as to prevent desired coating
from forming. In other words, the temperature of the casting is so controlled by
heat transfer to the die or mold and casting itself (air or liquid blown there
against) so that, when the coating material (plastic, chromate, or any other) is
applied thereto, the surface to which it is applied will be at the correct
temperature for best results. If thermoplastic plastic is sprayed from the
mandrel or extension as a powder, solution or molten spray against the inside
surface of the  pipe as it extrudes or is formed to shape as in casting, the
temperature of the surface receiving said plastic is preferably  just above the
melting point of the plastic (300 degrees F to 500 degrees F for most plastics).
The coating material may also be extrusion coated onto the inside surface of the
pipe from the mandrel. It may also comprise ceramic or metal sprayed onto the
inside surface of the moving casting as a molten liquid or powder. Powdered
aluminum, for example, may be introduced thru the mandrel and applied as a spray
or flurdized mass flurdizing taking place by also JC - 8/16/63 LW 9/8/63 THIS

steel extrusion or casting which is at a temperature such that the aluminum
powder will be caused to melt on said surface as an integral coating of uniform
thickeners. The gas may be next so as not to oxidize the surface of the steel
and may also be used to convey the powder: Powdered glass or ceramic materials
may also be applied to the inside surface of the pipe by spray. If fluidization
of powder is used, pipe may be horizontally or upwardly cast permitting
fluidization or so disposed when powder is introduced. (i.e extension of mandrel
may be bent to ~~ fo ~~ conform to shape of extrusion) and temperature of the
casting is such as to cause the powder to melt and fuse with a uniform coating.
Curtain powdered or liquid materials may also be flame sprayed against the
interior surface of the casting (by mounting flame spraying head on mandrel or
extension thereof and feeding flame spraying (s) ~~ th ~~ as well as coating
material thru mandrel) Exterior surface(s) of casting or extrusion may also be

the radial movement of the pick up and recording transducer may be controlled to
position said transducer by means of feed-back signals derived from the shaft of
said motor or from optically scanning the grooves of the record during radial
movement of the arm by means of a photoelectric scanner mounted on the arm which
generates a pulse in scanning across a groove of the record. Once the
reproduction transducer is positioned in or adjacent the desired portion of the

Method of Molding A method of molding decorated articles is conceived in which a
sheet or film of decorated plastic (or metal) is pressure drawn into a cavity in
a mold or forced therein to conform to the shape of the cavity wall after which
(when the film is retained in position) molding material is injected or
otherwise admitted to the cavity of the mold and molded against the pressure
formed film or sheet (thermoformed or otherwise) to become integral therewith
during the molding process by fusing therewith or physically interlocking with
portions of the sheet so formed. Globe Structure A world globe is conceived
consisting of two shells each of which comprises a sphere assembled of
respective half shells, one inside the other. The inner shell is made of thin
vacuum formed plastic sheet with countries of the world printed on its outer
surface. The outer spherical shells is injection molded of two pieces and its
inside diameter is approximately the outside diameter of the inside shell.
Molded flanges of the outer shell halves snap together and retain flanges or
flange portions of the inner shell at the same time. 10-10-63 VM EJW 10/24/63

When the materials have all been selectively applied to the mold wall, the
molding material is applied thereto and is operative to fuse with the decorating
material in a bond ~~ sh ~~ which is stronger that the bonds between the applied
material and the mold wall to retain the applied material integral with the
molded article. Jerome Lemelson ~~ Structure ~~ Also illustrated in Fig. 1 is an
assembly 38 including a source 39 of intense light in the form of a pattern or
image to be projected against the surface 25 for correspondingly causing the

light thereby leaving discrete areas of positive charge to attract the
negatively charged particle to the light source 39 is mounted on arm 38 which is

article to impart special characteristics thereto, not preordered by the

generating an intense magnetic field in or around the mold (or die) to cause
working of the molded or extruded piece. (d) In a fourth technique, a large
force is applied with an actuator to the wall of the mold or die (either as a

Blow Mold Decor. – Por plug Decoration of Blow Molded Items It is conceived to
decorate articles as they are blow molded (or possibly vacuum drawn items or
items which are formed by pressure forcing a sheet of plastic) as follows: (a)
Provide a portion of the wall of the mold adjacent those portions of the piece
to be molded made of a porous material such as porous sintered metal (stainless
steel, ceramic or other material which is porous). (2) Feed printing material
such as ink, lacquer or other colorant for the surface of the item to be
decorated through the porous portions by one of two methods (a) either under
constant low pressure feed or (b) program control the feed (or pressurization of
the decorating material to be pulsed just as the plastic parison or sheet is
blown thereagainst) to cause a quantity of said material to be imprinted on the
areas of the blown article aligned with the porous wall portions and to for
decorations or illustrations thereon; apply suction if necessary to the porous
member thereafter to prevent exusion or spillage of the decorating material. If
necessary, heat the porous portions continuously.

Strain Gage Construction A new type of strain gage thermocouple is conceived
consisting of a vacuum deposited or electron beam deposited sensing element
bonded to a layer of oxidized metal or oxide material provided on a strip,
filament or other wire shaped metal which strip, etc. is welded or bonded to the
test specimen. Fabrication technique include. I. (a) Provide a base strip of
metal such as stainless steel, titanium, zirconium or any suitable alloy. ~~
Deposite ~~ Either deposite a layer of metal on a surface of said strip and
oxidize the surface thereof or the entire layer, or oxidize a strata of the
surface of the strip or vacuum deposite an insulating oxidizing material onto
the surface of the strip. (b) Next selectively deposit strain gage or
thermocouple sensing element onto the upper surface of the oxide or insulating
material to the desired shape. This may be done by beam thru a mask, by beam or
heat etching thru a mask placed over a deposited layer of said sensing or

Beam etch Beam oxidizing strain gage material, by selective beam deposition. (c)
Provide lead attachments to ends of sensing element or complete a microminiature
circuit therewith by vacuum and beam deposition means which circuit includes
amplifying and short wave transmission means to transmit signals from the strain
gage on thermocouple element as it operates. A battery may also be deposited for
powering the circuit or induction coupling means to generate electrical energy
for powering said circuit when subjected to a changing magnetic field or a
thermoelectric generating element or elements may be vacuum deposited or
attached to the circuit as deposited for powering same. * (d) Next step is to
vacuum deposite or otherwise apply an insulating coating over the sending
element. This may be accomplished by techniques such as

Plate - meth of making circuits oxidize to provide any shape described, namely
either depositing an insulating material such as magnesium, oxide, al oxide,
titanium oxide, or fluorides of metals such as these or by depositing a layer of
metal and completely converting same to an oxide, fluoride, etc or by converting
the exposed surface of the sensing element to an oxide by exposure, for example,
to Hydrogen fluoride gas, etc. Plating and heat or beam etching technique may be
applied to the above procedures. Also signal generated by strain gage or
thermocouple may be capacitatively inductively transferred to another circuit by
providing a deposited inductor in circuit with the strain or thermocouple
element as disclosed in a previous notebook of mine.

Also proposed to Joe Lieberman and Sam Freimauer yesterday, Jan 24 was the  idea
of molding different size housings to accommodate records of different diameters
(i.e. a housing larger than they are now planning to produce for sale to doll
manufacturers so that a larger record may be used for use of the unit in a
mechanical toy, game or larger doll) The following improvements and

proposed to Mr's Freemauer and Lieberman to reduce the costs thereof and improve
its performance. In return, I expect to be paid a royalty for any and all units

and apparatus for producing an audio speaker may be patentable and I intend to
file patent applications, if so: (A) Thermoformed speaker and/or diaphragm
therefore. Since the diaphragm is relatively thin and its support or frame
heavier, it is conceived to thermoform a sheet of thermoplastic ( into a cavity

later reinforced by attaching it to a molded frame, etc. II Entire diaphragm,
