# Lemelson Protocol Artifact: GOLDEN-EXAMPLE-LEMELSON

## 1. Invention Thread

**IT1**: Single-shot dispenser package for small, single-use liquid doses.
**Context**: Lemelson records a conception and intent to file for disposable dispensers and packaging variants (§2).
**Why it matters**: Single-use dosing drives low-cost, hygienic distribution in medical and consumer contexts.
**Anchors**: §2

## 2. Conception Record

### CR1: August 4, 1959
**Statement**: Record of Conception for low-cost single-use dispensers with multiple embodiments and packaging methods, intended for patent filing (§2).
**Witness**: Read & understood signatures appear throughout the notebooks (§11, §12).
**Anchors**: §2, §11, §12

## 3. Variant Slate

### V1: Flexible sheet-sealed pouch
**Description**: Heat-sealed plastic sheet forming a pouch closure for dispensing.
**Anchors**: §2 [inference]

### V2: Narrow neck for direct application
**Description**: A small neck for controlled dispensing into a cavity (e.g., nostril).
**Anchors**: §2 [inference]

### V3: Roll or strip format
**Description**: Multiple dispensers attached in a strip for sequential use.
**Anchors**: §2 [inference]

## 4. Manufacturing Notes

### M1: Sealed sheet fabrication
**Materials**: Thin plastic sheets (.001-.005")
**Method**: Heat sealing or welding around pouch boundaries.
**Joining**: Heat seal/weld lines to form reservoir and neck.
**Anchors**: §2 [inference]

## 5. Tests & Samples

### T1: Sample material acquisition
**Purpose**: Evaluate material properties for sealing and dispensing.
**Procedure**: Obtain samples of adhesive or plastics and test seal strength.
**Outcome**: Pending sample evaluation.
**Anchors**: §118, §269 [inference]

## 6. Disclosure & Partner Log

### D1: Partner outreach
**Disclosure**: Demonstrations and discussions with manufacturers for production.
**Terms**: Confidentiality emphasized in multiple disclosures (§1, §13, §16).
**Follow-up**: Track callbacks and agreements (§10, §16, §220).
**Anchors**: §1, §10, §16, §220

## 7. Adversarial Critique

### C1: Missing sample evaluation results
**Why it breaks**: Feasibility remains speculative without test outcomes.
**Fix**: Run and log seal-strength tests once samples arrive.
**Anchors**: §118, §269 [inference]
