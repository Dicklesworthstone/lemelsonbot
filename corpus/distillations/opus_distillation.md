# Jerome H. Lemelson Methodology Distillation — Opus Lens (Philosophical/Epistemic)

## 1. Axioms (3-5 items)
- **Invention is a documented act, not a private thought**.
  - Evidence: Formal “Record of Conception” entries tied to patent intent (§2, §20, §21).
  - Implication: Ideas become real only when they are committed to a traceable record.

- **Credibility is social**: Witnesses transform a private claim into a shared fact.
  - Evidence: Repeated “read and understood” witness signatures (§11, §12, §19, §24).
  - Implication: The notebook is a social artifact, not just a personal diary.

- **Ideas must meet the world through fabrication**.
  - Evidence: Emphasis on molding methods, seals, and material systems (§20, §22, §14).
  - Implication: An idea without manufacturing constraints is incomplete.

- **Disclosure is a controlled boundary**.
  - Evidence: Notes about confidentiality, agreements, and guarded disclosures (§13, §16, §1).
  - Implication: The inventor actively manages who is allowed into the idea-space.

- **Commercialization is part of the method**.
  - Evidence: Repeated visits, demonstrations, and follow-ups with companies (§1, §9, §17, §33, §220).
  - Implication: Lemelson treats outreach and negotiation as intrinsic to invention.

## 3. Anti-Patterns (5-10 items)
- **Silent invention**: Ideas kept private lack social verification (contra §11, §24).
- **Disclosure without terms**: Leaks erode bargaining power (contra §13, §16).
- **Manufacturing amnesia**: Ignoring materials/process leads to fantasy designs (contra §20, §22).
- **Single embodiment fixation**: Narrowness undermines patent scope (contra §7, §14).
- **Unrecorded experiments**: Results disappear and can’t be used as evidence (contra §5).
- **No follow-up discipline**: Partner interest decays without tracked commitments (contra §10, §16).
- **Sample neglect**: Ignoring material samples leaves feasibility ungrounded (contra §118, §269).

| Disclosure | Controlled sharing of ideas | The notebooks track who saw what and under which conditions. |
| Prototype | Physical model | Used to confront feasibility and to persuade manufacturers. |

## 5. Decision Procedures (3-5 items)

PROCEDURE: Socialize the Invention
1. Record conception with date and intent.
2. Obtain witness signatures.
3. Disclose selectively with confidentiality terms.
IF partner interest arises THEN log it and prepare models.

PROCEDURE: Make It Buildable
1. Specify materials and fabrication processes.
2. Identify sealing/joining constraints.
3. Run experiments on key material properties.
IF experiments fail THEN revise the design and record changes.

PROCEDURE: Expand Claim Space
1. Establish a core mechanism.
2. Generate variants and list them explicitly.
3. Link variants to figures and prior filings.
IF a variant is strong THEN incorporate into application notes.
