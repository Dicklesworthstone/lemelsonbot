January 10, 1961 (Enroute to Washington) I visited Thomas Scarpa, president of
International Ultrasonic Corp., Cranford, N.J. yesterday and discussed my soon
to issue patent for Ultrasonic Apparatus with him yesterday. Additional designs,
modifications and applications for this ducted transducer were suggested by me
to him as follows – (a) Use of the ducted ultrasonic transducer of constant
outside diameter shown in my patent application - Ultrasonic Apparatus for (1)
Cleaning or unblocking clogged pipes by directing it therein on the end of a
flexible conduit and operating the transducer per se. I also suggested, and will
file an application on a transducer arrangement with the end of the duct
surrounding the transducer being servo driven to tilt, rotate or angulate while
in the pipe to (a) assist in the unblocking action (b) clean the wall of the
pipe, (c) inspect the inside of the pipe. I also conceive of combining a small
television camera adjacent the transducer or with any electrical or mechanical
(rooter) to visually see what is going on during or before or after the
unblocking action. (2) Mentioned to Scarpa was the possibility of using my
ducted tool as a probe to place into a liquid for chemical reactions (a drawing
Figs. 1 to 5 was left with him) THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ AND UNDERSTOOD by

Jan 10, 1961 (3) Also mentioned was my embodiment in which the duct ~~ ed ~~
housing the transducer is provided with a fluid circulating system which
includes means for removing eroded material, filter, fluid circulating system
etc. Other variations conceived by me which are or will become the subject of
patent applications are as follows (4) Provision for positional adjustment of
transducer in housing of my embodiment in Figs 1 and 2. Adjustment of
transducer(s) towards and away from the orifice. (5) Provision ~~ for ~~ of an
inlet to the housing adjacent the orifice thru which ultrasonic energy is
directed for (a) a blast of a stream of high velocity liquid, gas or ~~ ste ~~
vapor such as steam to be admitted during, prior to or after ultrasonic
transducing to assist in the eroding or cleaning action. Jet or blast to be
directed thru openings in ~~ housing ~~ housing against ~~ to ~~ work surface
which housing abuts and/or directed against part of housing to assist in removal
of particles, dirt, etc removed from work surface. (6) Admission (to housing
surrounding transducer) of material such as abrasive particles etc. which will
aid in eroding. THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ AND UNDERSTOOD BY EJW DATE 1/14/61

energy is directed. Application may include ultrasonic machining or deburring.
(7) Provision of removable adaptors or duct ends of my device for cleaning
ultrasonically such articles as (disclosed to Scarpa) (a)spark plugs (on the
engine block or removed), which adaptor heads include shaped rubber nose
portions to circumscribe the part, (b) to fit over nuts, bolts, etc. to remove
rust, seizing, calking, etc (8)Provision of an end adapter for my ducted tool
which clamps on (by closure of jaws, etc - and seals around a work piece having
an irregular or expanding shape; and transducer which may be automatically
operated after admission of liquid ~~ to ~~ resulting closed chamber to move
about and scan surface of work as it operates thereon. (9) Also discussed with
Thomas Scarpa was my idea for designing my ultrasonic tool in the shape of a
pistol grip or gun the trigger of which would be coupled to a switch for
energizing the transducer and/or simultaneously admitting a liquid to the
chamber surrounding the transducer. A particular control arrangement would be
one in which a single trigger or switch JL Jan 10, 1961 THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER

### Page 10
actuation would result in the simultaneous actuation of the transducer and
admission of a liquid to the chamber surrounding the transducer (either
predetermined quantity of liquid or continuous flow thereof out the chamber or
circulated therein while nose is in sealing engagement with the work). When the
switch or trigger is released or opened, the transducer energy input is cut off
and either the liquid flow (valve) is closed or the action includes removal of
all liquid from the chamber. JL Jan 10, 1961 I have been working on patent
applications for the following inventions which I intend to file as soon as I
finish them. I. Thermoplastic Recording Apparatus, devices and methods II. A
thermoplastic or ~~photographic ~~ apparatus for reproducing still records and
sound signals from a photographic or T.P.R. recording (i.e. an electronic

entering billing information into computers over telephone lines. Typical
current problems the correction of bills, premiums, additions where there are
many accounts serviced by different representatives, salesmen, delivery men who
report to local offices which information must be transmitted via phone lines to
district offices containing businesses machines and/or computers. Fuel billing

to 1600 stations periodically which is then distributed to thousands of service
stations. In insurance billing, the larger companies require information
scanning of 9 digit alpha-numeric information to account for policy number,
amount billed, variation, amt. paid, etc A number of systems have been conceived
viz. System #I (brief description) This system employs a form, 12 preferably the
size of the bill or receipt (7 1/2" x 8 1/2") which the driver leaves with each
customer upon delivery. The form is preferably stiff paper or card stock. If
simple information such as gallons delivered per trip is ~~ des ~~ the variable
to be recorded at least 25 and possibly 30 entries may be made on one card by
the person making the delivery or a clerk after delivery. The form, as
conceived, utilizes a binary code (although when a character reader is perfected

defines one end of 22 against which an edge of the card 12 is placed when
placing said card thru the opening 21 for alignment with reading means situated
within 20'. During the reading function, the card 12 is driven in two
directions, first a predetermined distance into the housing as directionally
defined by arrow *A* and then in a direction normal thereto in the direction
defined by arrow *A'.* The degree of movement into the housing in the direction
of "A" is sufficient to center the row or rows of binary (or numerical)
recordings to be read by fixed transducers 31 when the card is driven normal
thereto in direction A' to produce a binary serial code on output 31W. which, as
stated, may extend to a computer, recorder, transmitter, etc. A first drive
means for the card comprises a plurality of elongated rolls which functionally
engage and  the card after it has entered the housing until the card is
prepositioned within the housing after which certain of the rolls retract
automatically after other rolls engage the card for moving it laterally thru the
housing and out an opening 21' in end-wall 20-4 during which lateral movement
reproduction transducing or scanning is effected. JL 2/1/61 THIS CONFIDENTIAL

The first drive means comprises a plurality of bottom rollers 26 which are free
wheeling and are supported on their shafts in bearing by journals 26B which are
secured to a partition 20-7 which extends between the side-walls of the housing.
A plurality of upper rollers 27 are power operated by a motor 30 to drive the
card into the housing when engaged against its upper surface. The rollers ~~ and
m ~~ are bearingly supported on a U-frame 28 by means of a push-pull  29 secured
to top wall 20-5, from a retracted position where the rollers 27 are disengaged
from the card to a projected position engaging the rollers against the card for
driving it into the housing. A  switch 25 having a pivoting activator arm which
is moved by the card upon entering the slot or shortly thereafter ~~ used to
energize the solenoid 29 projecting the upper rollers 27 to engage the card. The
switch 25 is also connected to start motor 30 which drives one or more of the
upper rollers thru gears 30-6 coupled to the shafts of the motors and rollers. A
first pick-up transducer 31' (X) is positioned to read the indicating
recording(s) or mark(s) provided on column 12-10. If a single mark is used to
indicate the position of the row requiring reading then the first pulse

used to stop drive motor 30 although 30 may be in constant rotation. The relay
31'R in the output 31'W of 31' is also adapted to advance input 36F of a second
solenoid 36 which advances a second ~~ group of ~~ roller or rollers 33 against
the card to drive it laterally thru the housing in the direction of A'. The
drive rolls 33 comprise two rollers 33a and 33b made of rubber or other suitable
material which rotate about lateral axes and cooperate with free wheeling rolls
32a and 32b when advanced against the surface of the card. A frame 3d supports
rollers 33 in bearing and drive motor 35 which is operatively coupled through
and conventional gear drive to the shaft of ~~at/~~the roll 33a and/or 33b by
means of a belt or chain drive (not shown). The output of transducer pickup 31'
is used both to effect retraction of the first drive roll assembly containing
rolls 27a and 27b and the advancing of the assembly 33 to engage rolls 33a and
33b against the card in cooperation with rolls 32a and 32b. After the card has
been driven out of the housing, a second limit switch 38 mounted on end wall
20-4 and having an over-ride actuator arm which momentarily closes a set of
contacts when it rides ~~of ~~ over the end edge of the card as it passes out

Fig. 7 is a schematic diagram of the electrical controls for the card reader
devices of Figs. 4 to 6. It is assumed, for the purpose of presenting a
simplified drawing, that the correct power supply is provided on the correct
sides of all switches, relays, controls, etc. The electrical system will be
described by describing a cycle of operation. Limit switch 25 is actuated when
the card enters the slot in the housing 20 and pulses or energizes the start
control 30F of motor 30 and the  projection  advance input 29F of solenoid 29.
Drive rolls 29 drive the card into the housing until pick-up 31' senses a signal
or mark in column 12-10 which produces a pulse on the outputof the amplifier 31A
in the circuit of 31'. The pulse is passed to the stop control 30S of motor 30,
retract control 29R of 29,  projectio advance control input 36F of motor 35
Which then causes the card to be driven in the direction of A' with the pick-up
31 aligned with the row 12b to be read. Shown in Fig. 7 is a recording member 48
such as a paper or magnetic tape or recording film on a channel of which the
pulse train generated on the output of 31 is to be recorded. A recording
transducer 45a is shown positioned for recording on a predetermined channel of

The notation 43a refers to a ~~push button~~, switch such as a bi-stable
push-button or solenoid operated switch in the output of 31 the function of
which will be described. Since cards will be intermittently fed to reader 20, if
it is desired to space each message or pulse train close together it will be
necessary to ~~start and~~ stop the tape during the interval each new card is
being prepositioned in the machine. Actuation of switch 25 may therefore be
utilized to start the tape drive motor 46 by energizing the start input 46F
thereof which motor may be time controlled to run for the time interval
necessary for scanner 31 to reproduce from the entire row 12b it is scanning and
then automatically stopped. The pulse output of limit switch 25 is therefore
also passed to a time delay relay 47 which energizes the stop control 46S of
tape drive motor 46 at the proper time after starting. Upon exiting from the
reader, the card causes the over-ride limit switch 41 to become actuated which
pulses the stop control 35S of motor 35 and the retract control of 36R of
solenoid 36. The pulse output of 41 may also by passed to the servo 49 which
feeds the next card into reader 20. In the event that it is desired to

A switching means 43 is provided in the outputs of the card reading transducer

head 31" adjacent each row scanning head, which head 31" may scan a mark,
cut-out or pulse recording 12 P' in the column 12a which indicated that the code
on the adjacent 12b column is to be read out. The output of 31" is used to
energize a solenoid 31S, which is sufficiently slow to retract to retain a pair
of contacts 43-SW, in the circuit between the pick-up 31 and the output 31W' to
the recording transducer 45 or transmitter, for a time interval for the entire
respective row 12b of the card to the read. While the lower contact 43' of
switch contact pair 43 SW is movable by solenoid 3/5 to contact the upper point
43", the upper contact 43" is also movable to be retained against 43' by a
bi-stable actuator 43P or push-button. Thus, The actuator 43 may be manually
operated to predetermine which of the rows 12b will be reproduced from. It is
noted that each the contact closure solenoids 31S may also have an engizing

In Fig 9 is illustrated ~~oneons for~~ circuit components for controlling gating

signals ~~ on t ~~ on the card reader output circuit 31-W from those transducers
which scan rows which have been last entered as part of a partucular order,
delivery, purchase, date entry, etc. It was specified heremabove that for each

is marked with an indication mark 12P or has a pulse rrecording provided
thereon. Assuming that the card 12 passes thru the reader in the direction A'
with the leading edge 12-10' of column 12-10 first passing the lateral array of
reproducing heads 31-, then the at  energization or actuation of at least one of
the heads will indicate that the sub-column relating to the latest entry is in
alignment with all heads. The output of each of the scanners 31-a, 31-b, 31-c,

Assuming that pick-up transducer 31-a scans and reproduces a pulse from the
first sub-column of 12-10 to pass the heads 31-, then the output of 31-a is
passed thru a time delay relay 52b then thru a normally closed switch 50-b to
the switching input of a second ~~ m ~~ normally closed switch 51b which it
causes to open which opening is effected for the time interval in which the
entire row ~~ 12 of ~~ 12b of recordings passes all scanners so that the output
of 31-b which must pass thru 51-b will not be able to pass therethru. The time
delay interval of 52b is such that in the event that scanner-transducer 31b also
~~ reproduced ~~ scanned a mark or signal in the same sub-column of 12-10 that
31a scanned its first sensory marks or signal, the output of 31b will have
sufficient time, when passed to the switching input of normally closed switch
50b to effect the opening of said switch before the output of 31a is passed
therethru to open 51b. Switch 50b is therefore sufficiently slow-to-close to
permit the entire row scanned by 31b to be read. Similarly, the output of 52b is
passed thru normally closed switches 50c and 50d to open respective switches 51c
and 51d breaking the output circuits 31w-c and 31w-d from their respective THIS

51-c and 51-d. In other words, the switching means of Fig. 9 permits any circuit

the frame and line code matching relays 22a and 22b may also be energized by
selection codes obtained from recordings or magnetic tape 31. Pick -up head 36
reproduces sereal codes from 31 which are converted to parallel code in shift

operates driving tape 31 until selection signal pick-up 36 reproduces a
selection code and video pick-up 35 reproduces a tone signal or code to which
relay 39 is responsive which transmits a signal to the stop control S of motor

driven on its transport until frame photomultiplier reading band 24a reading
code marks on strip 13a produce a parallel binary code which is transmitted to
the frame selection code matching relay 22a, which code is equal to the
selection code set up on the inputs 21 whereupon the output 22W of 22a becomes
energized with a signal which is passed to

start motor 34 and head 35 reproduces the next signal on channel 31b of tape 31
which is passed to writing scanner 30, the beam of which it modulates to create
the desired image on the selected strip area or lateral row of the selected
frame of film 25. This may be accomplished with the film 25 in motion or stopped
depending on the operation of 30. at the end of reproduction of the desired
signals from track 31b of tape 31 a tone signal or code is reproduced by 35
which energizes a relay 39 the output of which is passed to ~~ 40 to open ~~ the
switching output of flip flop 40 to open said switch - The film 25 ~~ either ~~
continues in its motion ~~ (or is stopped until started manually)~~. The delay
relay 41 in the output of 39 permits tape 31 to continue to travel for
sufficient time for the next selection code to be picked up by lead 36 and to be
passed to shift register 37 which ~~ set ~~ actuates respective holding relays
of bank 38 which has previously been reset by the prior output of 22b. The cycle
then repeats. A reproduction control 46 connects output circuit 22W of 22a with

following signalling systems using ultrasonic ~~ singa ~~ (sound) signals have
been conceived. I. Paging or remote control system: (a) A relay transducer is
provided which becomes energized upon receipt of a sound signal of a specific
frequency or narrow frequency range. An ultrasonically vibratable transducer
provides an output signal which is amplified and used to energize a switch to
either open or close a circuit upon receipt of said signal. This may be used to
energize a ~~ relay ~~ servo, sound a buzzer, turn on a light, etc (b) The
receiver circuit may comprise a plurality of transducers each of which is
energizable to provide an output signal or JB 2/15/61 EC 2/15/61

will energize respective of said transducers. The outputs of the transducer for
a specific relay or receiver may be connected to a logical AND circuit so that
if all are energized at the same time, the AND relay will produce an output
which may be used to energize a servo, close or open a switch, etc for control
purposes. In this way, different arrangements of transducers responsive to
different frequencies may be used to control different devices in a given
location (a factory floor for example). The transmitter may comprise plurality
of push button switches which, when activated would, each generate an ultrasonic
signal of a different frequency. The output transmitter may also be controlled

N.Y. after noticing their Ultrasonic level control in action. I conceived of
this being used for liquid metal level control and discussed this with him
including the following conceived ideas which I intend to file a patent on. The
Ultrasonic probe is coupled to the exterior surface of the mold or flow chamber
into or through which liquid metal is flowed and senses the level of the liquid
metal. 4/18/61 MW

In this way the probe need not contact the liquid metal. The salesman said he
had not heard of such an application and that the transducer or probe was
guaranteed for operation to only 500° F. However upon questioning him, I
discovered that Powertron's transducer is a welded, not epoxy resin bonded,
assembly and that it is magnetostructrally operated. Therefore I stated that it
could be calibrated above 500° F for high temperature operation and that the
transducer and/or mold could be liquid cooled if necessary to reduce its
temperature. I told him that I would that in touch with his company regarding
this and my other near ultrasonic devices for possible licensing. I also
conceived of an application to a casting wheel where the ultrasonic transducer
is movable on an arm to contact the exterior surface of ~~ the ~~ a mold of a
plurality of wheel mounted molds at the level desired in casting to sense the
metal when it reaches said predetermined level, and provide a signal to effect
termination of metal flow by control of a servo regulating flow which transducer
then retracts off the mold permitting rotation of the wheel. The arm mounting

adhesive material. Mr. Norman J. Gallop, Technical Sales Representative
introduced me to their chief chemist Mr. Sussman and spoke with their chemist
doing research ( named Dick) on the subject. In my discussions with their chief
chemist, I asked if they had tried to use copper or aluminum powders as filler
conductor materials rather than silver which is quite expensive. When they
informed me that they had not been successful with these due probably to the
oxide film which forms on the surface of the particles, I remarked that perhaps
these materials could be used if they were mixed with the plastic either
immediately after forming prior to becoming oxidized or if they were kept rom
oxidizing by forming them (by flame spraying) in an inert atmosphere free of
oxygen or oxidizing material. He, Mr. Sussman, stated that this would be a
research project on itself Since this appears to me to be a worthwhile project I

plastics by forming oxygen free copper, aluminum or lead powders and retaining
them oxygen free while mixing them with an epoxy resin or other suitable LW

material such as nylon, filled with conducting powder which may be injection or
compression molded. I conceive of the possibility of doing this by utilizing

particles of plastic (thermoplastic) and molding the mixture by the application
of heat and pressure Also discussed with them were ideas I have conceived for
applying their epoxy or any other conducting plastic formulation as films to

data is originally provided on a sheet of paper or card (punched or plain) and
that updating is effected by typing or otherwise entering information on one or
more lines provided below those on which information has already been entered,
as in standard bookkeeping practice. Each document is of standard, predetermined

documents are scanned in a predetermined sequence and the video picture signals
of each are automatically recorded in place of the old picture signals.
Documents are sorted to place them in said predetermined sequence by punched
card or other techniques. Old picture signals are all erased. II. Second system
is modification of first system in which a document recording of a ~~ is er ~~
tandem or other array thereof is erased only on command, that is only ~~ when a
~~ in response to a signal generated upon scanning or in response to receipt of
a document which contains information to be added to or taken out of the video
picture signal recording. This may be determined by the presence of the card,
scanning ~~ of ~~ one or more codes printed, punched or otherwise recorded
thereon, etc. and by utilizing one or more code matching relays as in my
application ser. no . III. The third system involves erasure and/or recording of
part of a video picture signal (derived in scanning one or more lines of image
information) by either gating means as described in

REFINING & UPGRADING OF METAL 1. Electron Beam Technique-a patent application
will be prepared for a method of refining metal which comprises the steps of
heating metal in an air evacuated container to a melt condition, using a first
electron beam

EL 7/16/62 JC 7/24/62

THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER WITNESSED & UNDERSTOOD BY: EJW DATE 7/16/62

to traverse the melt and zone refine the metal, and using either the same
electron beam or a further beam to introduce a second material into the metal
(such as a ceramic such as AlO2, ZrO2, TiO2, etc.) either in the vaporous state
or as particles in the quantity of 1% to 10% or less which second material
eventually becomes part of the grain boundary of the metal (crystals) when the
melt solidifies and improves the crystalline structure. 2. A method of
continuously casting and (zone) refining metal is conceived in which metal is
introduced into an open ladle in a vacuum or inert atmosphere, refined by
continuous scanning with an electron beam to purge the impurities towards one
end of the ladle or the pure metal away from the impurities, the refined metal
is fed into the first opening in the ladle or container which communicates with
a vertically extending continuous casting mold and continuously cast into a long
billet (metal billet may be drawn by a conveyance such as plural power operated
wheels engaging the surface of the solidified billet). Metal containing
impurities may be continuously ~~ or inter ~~ removed from

vaporizing metal in a vacuum or controlled atmosphere, then scanning the ~~ l ~~
vapor as it is formed with one or more electron beams in a manner to cause the
pure metal constituent of the vapor to be directed by the beam along a
predetermined path or paths against a surface to form a solid of predetermined
purity. The material directed by the beam may be predetermined or varied by beam
intensity, controlling beam frequency and generation of a magnetic field of
predetermined characteristics in the volume of the vapor and beam. In this
respect, it is conceived to employ an electron beam and a controlled or
controllable intense steady or oscillating magnetic field surrounding the beam
for (a) controlling the flow of material in or into said beam, (b) seperating
materials in said beam, (c) heating material(s) in or adjacent said beam to a
vaporous state, (d) affecting material deposited by the beam, (e) affecting

chemical and/or physical changes therein as described above or on pages 43 to

Instead of using a solid ruby rod or (neodymium) glass rod for generating laser
action, a hollow rod or bundle of rods or filaments which are hollow (preferably
cylindrical in shape) may be utilized to advantage (i.e. with one end half
silvered and the other silvered for laser action). A number of advantages are
noted: For a laser consisting of one or more hollow rods in which light
amplification is provided, the laser may be energized by light generated both
exterior of and inside the hollow rod or tube. Interior light may be generated
by gaseous electrical discharge within the closed end rod or tube, by spark
discharge therein, by and exploding core therein, ~~ etc ~~ by pulsing or
generating a plurality of light sources therein simultaneously or in sequence,
by combustion within the tube, etc. Light generated exterior of the tube
(optional) may be passed through a half-silvered EL 10/19/62 THIS CONFIDENTIAL

bright lights. The light may be the same or different from that generated within
the tubes. The ruby or glass tube may also be filled with a gas or plasma in
which laser action may simultaneously occur with the laser action in the wall of
the tube. Or said tube may be filled with a liquid in which laser action may
occur. Conventional currently utilized liquids and gases in which laser/light
pumping/action occurs maybe used. If the tube is constructed with changes in its
internal crossection, light may be passed both thru the solid laser material and
the liquid or gaseous laser material. (2.) Fine, hollow filaments of laser glass

Illinois Glass Works may be used as a bundle per se or in cooperation with a
supporting structure such as a larger tube or rod or may be filled with such

the noble gas, ~~ a ~~ fine wires may be sealed in the tubing or conductive
coating may be printed or otherwise applied thereto for providing the electrodes

or different lasers and utilize the amplified light output of one to excite the
other or next in line. If one laser is operated to provide pulsed light, its
frequency may be tuned or predetermined relative to the frequency of the next or
others. A plurality of first lasers may be positional to provide their outputs
feeding a second laser either continuously, or intermittently at the same or
different frequencies, in phase or out of phase with each other or in such a
timed relation that the output of each first feeding laser with be pulsed one
right after the other to provide a high frequency of light pulses in groups each

any ideas for marketing guns and I informed him that Darsey Mfg Co produce smoke

would not dispense too much at one time. I conceive of a construction in a toy

terminates at a small opening which is normally closed off by the piston  in the

(1) the hole in the bottom wall opens and (2) the powder in the general vicinity
of the opening is agitated so that a small quantity flows downward into the bore
of the barrel and/or onto a portion of the piston front face so that when the
piston moves forward and stops, the powder will be thrown off by inertia. The
powder may also be dispensed onto the missile being fired so that it trails
behind when the missile fired and is dispensed by the turbulent air behind the
missile. Or it may be depressed onto the bottom wall of the bore to be picked up
by the piston in its forward travel. Or, the operator may dispense powder onto
the missile (unto a retaining groove or shelf at the rear end of the missile,
prior to loading) Smoking toys using the above arrangements are conceived as
follows (a) A water gun which smoke, (b) A ball or bullet firing gun which
smokes (c) Cap firing gun which smoke (d) Suction cup dart gun smoke (e) Spring

rotary die(s), wire brush, burring, or other (buff, etc.) means to dull or
destroy part of the mirror finish to provide designs. The design may be
determined by: (i) the shape of the tool, brush or buff operating on the surface
of the extrusion as it extrudes (ii) a mask in the form of a closed loop
stainless steel belt with cut-outs maybe driven at the speed of the extrusion

Processing the extrusion. (g) Extruded sheet or other shape of aluminum may be
continuously formed as it extrudes with special tooling without ruining the

additive  ? impregnated into the sintering or incorporated in with the powdered
metal prior to sintering. (b) Surface coating a metal article with said
lubricant by incorporating the lubricant in with or coating particles of metal
or ceramic with the lubricant, applying them to a surface, and working them into
a solid metal (containing lubricant) coating for the surface by one of the
following: (i) shot blasted against powdered metal applied to the surface, (ii)
placement of the article to be coated into a die cavity of larger volume than

material to be coated. Compressing the article into the die (with or without
heating) and/or the powdered metal or material already in the die with cause
essentially coating or sintering said powder as a solid layer on the surface of
the article. The pressure may be such (as may temperature) as to cause the
powder to melt into a non-porous coating or to provide a porous coating with
lubricant filling the pores. J. Lemelson Caroline Murray 2/13/62 Feb. 13–1963
Continuing with the above lubricant additive and its polishing effects, the
following methods and articles have also been conceived: 2. A method for coating
an article with aluminum or other metal and creating a mirror finish on the
coating are conceived as follows: (a) Completely coat the surface of a rod or
wire, strip or sheet with metal such as aluminum. Then pass the coated piece
thru a drawing die lubricated by said G.E. additive with the diameter of the die
being slightly smaller than the diameter of the coating. In other words, the die
is not used to drawing the wire but only to smoothen the surface of the coating
and to impart final mirror finish thereto. E.L. 2/20/63 CM 2/25/63

### Page 162
otherwise, since the base were itself (if steel coated with aluminum) is not
being drawn, the coating material will only be drawn and perhaps removed from
the base. Diameter of the die will depend on such variables as uniformity of
coating, amount of surface working required to create mirror finish, etc.
Process may be continuous in which single line or pass is used to coat the wire,
draw it thru a die, then anodize or plastic coat the polished surface of the
coating. Heat of coating and/or drawing may be used to enhance or improve
anodizing or for plastic coating. Automatic temperature controls, means for
lowering or raising temperature where necessary, etc may be applied to
continuous process. Anodizing may be effected or enhanced by incorporating
anodizing chemicals in lubricant used for drawing and either connecting the die
or dies and/or other surfaces such as rollers (conducting rubber rollers)
contacting the wire as it is drawn in circuit with the necessary source of
electrical energy to effect anodizing of the polished surface of the coating.
The above procedure may be supplemented by also passing the coated and E.L

decrease in diameter by applying ultrasonic energy or electromagnetic field
which changes in characteristic at high frequency to enhance the polishing
action. An automatic control system for polishing as described is conceived in
which either the spacing of rollers or diameter of a die is varied in accordance
with feedback signals ~~ gene ~~ variations generated as a result of scanning
the thickness of the part or the finish imparted thereto. The feedback signal
may vary an electromagnetic field around the die or a serve positioning one or
both rollers. Jerome Lemelson Automatic or Programmed Planetary Mill The
following improvements in a planetary rolling mill employing either one
revolving planetary roller and a fixed die or a common (conventional) roll
cooperating with a planetary roller assembly are conceived. Ref. Fig. 1 to 3 p

fluid from the clothing and removing dirt therewith which has been dissolved in
said fluid. The hypersonic sound waves generated in the air/vapor surrounding
the clothes in the drum may also be operative to react with cloth or fabric of
the clothing so as to shake dirt, loosened by the cleaning fluid, off the

Reference is made to the process of extruding metal by the direct application of
a hydraulic fluid within the extrusion chamber to the face of a bullet. In one
process a hydraulic fluid is applied both to the bullet face and to the
extrusion itself after it has come out of the extrusion die. It is conceived by
me to work the metal of the extrusion to improve its crystalline structure,
reduce porosity, eliminate defects therein, etc by either intermittently
applying pressure to the upstream fluid and/or downstream fluid in the form of
low frequency pressure valves and/or high frequency waves concurrent with the
low frequency waves. These pressure fluctuations or waves E.L. 3/11/63 CM

closing valves extending to high and/or low pressure reservoirs, pumps, etc (b)
By starting and stopping pumps. (c) By spark discharge inside the fluid system
(intermittent spark) (d) By exploding wire, exposives, etc inside fluid system

this includes magneto structure rods, vibrating crystal, etc (f) By means of
creating and collapsing magnetic fields in the fluid and/or surrounding the

substantially conforming to the shape of the wall of the chamber. Material such
as powdered ceramic, metal or slugs to be extruded is admitted to chamber volume
13 thru a valve means 17 communicating with 13 thru opening 18. After admission
of a charge, the material is compacted against the die 20 by advancing the
piston 14and heat may be applied by means of induction coil means 11 at the end
of the chamber to melt or sinter mass 19. A sub-piston valve 15 is provided in
piston 14 to permit a liquid such as liquid metal, high temp hydraulic fluid
etc. to be admitted to chamber volume 13 after the piston is withdrawn.
Thereafter a combination of direct high pressure applied to the fluid behind the
slug or mass 19 and shock waves applied to the fluid are used to force the metal
thru die opening 20'. Notation 21 refers to a chamber downstream of the die
which may also be pressurized to support the die during extrusion. Pressure
fluctuations or shocks may be applied to the fluid in region 22 in synchronized
relation to the pressure variations applied to the fluid in region 13 to both
reduce stresses on the die and/or act to compact the material being extruded to
improve its internal structure by eliminating porosity, predetermining

ceramic, or plastic may be sprayed, brushed or otherwise disposed on the upper
surface 31 of 31. This may be silicone resin, ceramic, or any material capable
of  re  standing up to the temperatures at which the conductive rubble layer 32
operates. The structure 30 may be used to heat a house wall, or a street or
sidewalk to melt snow and ice. The entire structure may be fabricated by
spraying on conductive layer 32, emulating rubber or flexible plastic (or
asphalt) coating 33, as well as an insulating layer or base of rubber or latex
filled asphalt between layer 31 and 32 (reverse order) if necessary. In a
special application of the structure illustrated in Fig. 5, the base 31 may
comprise a wall of a room with conductive layer 32 on the inside thereof. Base
31 may also comprise a sheet of plastic or rubber (nonconducting) and may be
used as a curtain, blanket, etc. The surface of 32 of 32 or surface 33 of 33 may
be embossed CM 3/18/63 EL 3/22/63

or covered with a further material such as a cloth, web, flocking or other form
of fiberous material such as a rug, etc. bonded or otherwise required thereto.
The base 31 may also comprise a shaped sheet of metal such as a refrigerator
wall or box (for defrosting), an airplane wing panel, (for deicing) a rod or
tube (for jacketing capable of heating the tube from the outside, or inside
coating capable of heating the inside of the tube or pipe. A non-conducting
plastic, rubber, or ceramic would be provided at the interface 31'. The
structure 30 may be used in the fabrication of inflated domes and housings for
dwellings and shelters whereby the conducting layer 32 extends as bands, strips,
or volumes of conducting plastic or rubber seperated by areas or volumes of
non-conducting rubber in the same layer. The structure 30 may be entirely
flexible for inflatable structures such as shelters, bags, etc. for use in
industrial processes. A bag structure siding the layer structure 30 is conceived
for containing a chemical or raw materials which may be CM 3/18/63 EL 3/22/63

electrically connected to a source of electrical energy for fabricating
clothing, space or swim suits to be heated. Vehicle tires may be fabricated of
electrically heatable structure 30 as may other articles such as jacketing for
wire, pipe, etc. The flexible structure 30 (layers 31', 32 and 33) may be used
as a blanket or die adapted to heat and react on a sheet of plastic in
cooperation with another die of predetermined shape to effect shaping said
plastic. Jerome Lemelson The following improvements in Dental Thread or Floss
are conceived: (1) Pre-knotted floss - knots proceed at intervals of between one
and two inches in the floss as an aid in cleaning the teeth (2) Antiseptic
impregnated floss - either impregnate or mix antiseptic liquid or powder with
the wax coating the threadddd base, the thread itself or

Forming and Decorating Plastic Articles on A Continuous Basis. The following
apparatus so conceived by me for automatically producing plastic articles (ref.
my application entitled Display and Manufacturing Apparatus Therefore.)
Apparatus & Method #1 involves the steps of (a)Extruding a sheet of constant (or
predetermined variable) thickness plastic which may comprise low, medium CM
3/26/63 EL 3/22/63

### Page 229
of  or high density polyethylene or other plastic,  continu (b)Continuously
convey the sheet from the extruder past means for printing designs thereon
(electrostatic printing means may be utilized in which the sheet can remain
molten or semi-molten) or other rotary, press, etc. conventional printing means
may also be used, (c)then continuously vacuum (and or pressure) drawing the
sheet into article shapes into dies which move with the sheet such as dies
secured to flights of closed loop conveyor moving at the same speed as the sheet
with the sheet, printing means and dies synchronized or otherwise controlled in
their movement and operation such that the printed or otherwise applied
decorations will be registered with the dies and the  articles  will have so
vacuum formed will have registered decorations thereon. (d)and thereafter
automatically die-cutting the resulting articles from the sheet from which they
are formed by means of a rotary or flying die cutting means. The above process
may be subject to a number of variations CM 3/26/6 EL 3/22/63

### Page 230
including: (1)Extruding the original sheet of plastic with portions of the sheet
which are to be drawn into the molds having increased cross section (by means
such as developed in my patent & application for Extrusion Apparatus) (2)
Filling the formed articles (which may comprise bottles, tubes, cups and other
containers on a continuous basis immediately after they are vacuum drawn into
the molds ~~ either~~ while attached to the sheet and automatically capping the
filled containers with a second plastic sheet sealed thereto ~~ or closures ~~
prior to die cutting or— (2’) Automatically removing the containers from the
mold while retaining the prepositioning of each (without random release)

other objects having flexible walls (capable of inflation) may be produced
automatically as above of low, medium or high density polyethylene or other
flexible or rigid plastic. If inflatable or if desired to close these off at the
neck after CM 3/26/63 EL 3/22/63

### Page 231
filling, the neck of each may be sealed closed by compression between heated
dies. (4) The technique may be described may employ conventional extrusion
means, calendering means or means employing powdered polyethylene to form a
sheet per my prior disclosures. In other words, the sheet of plaster may be
extruded on to a stainless steel sheet belt and fed to a closed loop array of
molds, or formed on a drum or between drums and fed to vacuum drawing molds
attached to a second drum. (5) If conventional rotary printing press means is
employed to decorate the sheet, the sheet may be backed by the slainl drum
against which it is fed or the stainless steel sheet belt during printing and
while in either a semi-molten or rigid state. If in a rigid state, the sheet may
be heated to semi-molten condition thereafter prior to vacuum drawing. (6) If
electrostatic printing means (such as Xerox or other means previously disclosed
by me) are employed, it may be utilized in a position immediatly  in front of
the extrusion die or calender roll to effect said printing while the cm 3/26/63

thereafter immediately vacuum and/or pressure drawn into containers or other
shapes. 7. A technique for decorating a molded article is conceived in which a
mold (such as a vacuum forming, rotational, slush, etc) or other form of mold is
surface decorated with particles of plastic or other colorant material (inks,
paint,  etc) by metal, etc) by electrostatic printing means employing light
patterns, charge patterns developed thereby, etc. The particles may be powdered
thermoplastic or atomized droplets of liquid charged to deposit onto selected
areas of the mold. They may also be particles or spray of sheet on a material to
impart other characteristics to selected areas of the mold article molded in the
mold such as (a) conducting material (electrical resistive or otherwise), such
as copper powder or other), (b) solid film lubricant, (c) other metals, (d)
ceramic, (e) plastic with properties(strength, etc), other than that molded.
Thereafter the metal, plastic, ceramic or other material is molded to conform to
the wall(s) of the mold and the applied material applied CM 3/26/63 EL 3/22/63

of the mold by electrostatic deposition means becomes bonded or welded to the
wall of the article during the molding process In other words, the
electrodeposited material is molded onto the article and released from the mold

because of its solid condition during molding as compared to the molten or semi
molten state of the molding material, will give up the wall coating applied
thereto the electrostatic means during molding the artide 8. It is also
conceived to rotationally mold metal powder in a reducing atmosphere in a mold
the walls of which are heated above the melting or sintering point of the powder
and/or by applying and reducing flame, electric discharge are

shape—combinations of metal and ceramic, metal and glass or metal and plastic
may be so molded from powder and/or liquid state (i.e. liquid metal having
powdered ceramic added thereto as or prior to molding. 9. A metal or ceramic
molding technique is conceived in which intense flame heat is applied threw the
porous walls of a ceramic mold to melt powdered metal therein which may remain
or be rotationally molded or cast to shape. Jerome H Lemelson E. Lobasco 3/22/63
OPTICAL SCANNER— Reference is made to my previous disclosure for an optical
(electro-) scanning system employing a rotating disc having openings or maskfree
areas approximately the smape of the type being scanned. It is conceived to
provide the scanning disc with a thin film of CM 3/26/63 EL 3/30/63

### Page 235
electroluminescent material or thermo-plastic (TPR(G Electric) material and
including means for retaining images and means for beam scanning or otherwise
applying images to the disc such as images (clear ~~ or ~~ light transmitting
areas or areas free of deflection ripple patterns or light blocking areas) with
input means for generating a particular alpha-numeric type font (size and style)
on an annular band area of the disc for electro-optical scanning and comparison
as described. Thus, either under human or automatic means for detecting the type
being seamed, the comparator image areas on the disc may be charged to match the
type being scanned without charging discs or mask plates. Jerome Lemelson
PLASTIC FABRICATION PROCESSES & APPARATUS The following processes involve the
continuous extrusion of the thermoplastic materials such as polyethylene,
polypropylene, etc. into plastic sheet or film and its continuous vacuum drawing
into molds or containers for the purposes of (a) forming articles such CM
3/26/63 EL 3/30/63

### Page 236
as plastic bottles or tubes, (c) lining containers such as drums, cans, bottles,
paper, ~~or ~~corrugated or paperboard boxes. Methods & Apparatus include: I.
Continuously extrude or calender thermoplastic sheet, feed over or adjacent open
containers such as drums, boxes, cans, etc., clampingly engage the sheet against
the rim of the container and apply vacuum to the inside of the container (and/or
pressure above the sheet) while the sheet is semi-molten as the plastic sheet
being extruded and/or post heated, to draw the sheet into the container to form
a plastic liner, therefore which conforms to the shape of the container.
Containers are continuously fed on top of a belt conveyor or with the upper rim
of the container held by clamping means at the level of a belt or flight
conveyor parallel to the soft or semi-molten plastic sheet. Clamping of the
sheet against the rim may be effected by a second closed loop belt conveyor
disposed above the conveyor carrying the containers and above the sheet, or by a
flight of a closed loop flight conveyor. Vacuum may be applied to the inside of
each container to effect drawing the semi-molten sheet or film into the
container in one of several manners: viz(next page) CM 3/26/63 EL 3/30/63

### Page 237
(a) The container may be open at its lower end (i.e a bottomless can resting on
a conveyor flight which is later capped) (b) a small opening may be provided in
the lower end to which a conduit is attached  for applying vacuum. (c) the
bottom of the container may be porous or contain natural openings (i.e. folded
paper board carton, etc.) opening b) may be automatically closed off after so
leaving the containers. The left ( closed loop belt conveyor) on which the
container bottoms ride may be porous or made of screening capable of passing
air.  A plenum chamber from which air is constantly being withdrawn may be
placed beneath this belt in the vicinity of the location where the semi-molten
plastic sheet is drawn of the top of the container and the sheet will
automatically be drawn into the container when air i automatically drawn into
the plenum chamber through the belt from the inside of the container. An
apparatus is conceived in which the belt or flight conveyor carrying the
containers and (fired) the closed loop conveyr used to engage the plastic sheet
against the top of each container are adjustably movable away from each other to
accommodate containers of different heights. A method is also conceived CM
3/26/63 EL 3/30/63

### Page 238
in which the plastic sheet is not clampingly engaged against the open rims of
the containers but is merely brought thereagainst and drawn into the containers
by atmospheric pressure when vacuum is applied to the interior of the container.
Thus, additional plastic material from the surrounding sheet may be flowed into
the container (or mold) from the surrounding sheet of plastic and deeper draws
are possible without drawing the sheet to thin. For containers which do not have
bottom openings, air may be evacuated therefrom by the (automatic) insertion of
an open ended tube along the inside wall of the container from the open top
thereof to which tube vacuum is applied at the correct instant. After drawing
the plastic sheet to conform to the shape of the inside wall surface (and around
the then ~~ too ~~ tube, the tube is removed. A tool on pressure applied to the
container from the open end may be used to deform the plastic which conformed to
the tube shape or, the filling of the container thereafter with a product may
suffice to conform the lining to the wall, especially if the lining plastic is
flexible or thin. It is briefly noted that cap clamp CM 3/26/63 EL 3/30/63

### Page 239
a closure applied to the top of the container just prior to vacuum drawing may
be applied over the plastic sheet to dampingly engage it against the rim of the
container in place of the closed loop conveyor belt. These actions may all be

from Extruded Sheet Plastic as it is extruded based on certain of the
disclosures of pp 241 to 244 is conceived as follows:

In Fig. 1, a plurality of vacuum forming molds M1 to M5 are disposed in a
circular array and rotate on a frame or drum 12. As plastics extruder 14 is
disposed immediately above the drum 12 and is adapted to extrude a sheet 15 of
thermoplastic plastic onto the top of the drum 12 which is carried thereby as
the drum rotates across the open ends of the molds M4. A radiant heater 16 may
be disposed off CM 3/28/63 EL 3/30/63

### Page 240

Fig. 2 the extruding sheet 15 is above the drum to render the sheet 15 moldable
and a pair of wheels 17 ride against the borders of the sheet holding it against
the drum 12. Thereafter air is drawn from each mold as it reaches a particular
position and the sheet is drawn into the mold to form a deep drawn plastic part.
The ~~ mol ~~ vacuum molded container (while in the mold) may be automatically
filled as shown in Fig. 2 by dispensing a measured quantity of a producted into
the container lining the wall of the mold from a dispensing device or filling
head 20 synchronized in its operation to the rotation of the drums and molds. A
capping sheet 23 may be supplied from CM 3/28/63 EL 3/30/63

### Page 241
a second extruder or second die 21 and guided into abutment with the flange of
the first sheet at the top of the mold for forming a closure or cap for the
container in the mold after filling. The second sheet 23 may also be supplied
from a roll of plastic and may be automatic-ally vacuum formed to define shaped
closures before heat sealing or otherwise applying to the top of the molded
containers. At the locations of molds M4 or M5 in Fig. 1, automatic apparatus
may be provided for removing the molded containers from the molds. Holding
Aluminum or other metals Following methods are conceived. (1) Hollow bodies of
aluminum may be molded by disposing aluminum powder in a mold and either heating
the wall of the molds to or above the melting temperature of the aluminum as the
mold is rotated to cause the flow of aluminum onto the walls of the mold after
which the temperature is droped to solidify the molding (2) Process of (1) may
be modified by applying radiant heat on flame heat (from a plasma torch electron
beam laser etc. to the powdered metal as it

is introduced into the mold and/or as it engages the surface of the mold to melt
or fuse it onto the mold wall. A laser gun or electron beam gun may be disposed
to project its beam(s) into the stream of the powder as it is projected against
the wall of the mold. A tool is conceived which is a powder (metal plastic or
ceramic powder) dispensing gun (with or without electrostatic means for charging
the powder) using on intense electron and/or light beam(s) directed along or
otherwise into the flowing or sprayed strema of powder to melt it as it is
projected against a surface to be coated. (2) Blow molded aluminum objects A
sheet, sheets or tube of aluminum may be heated to a semi-molten condition and
blown into a mold with air or other fluid. Vacuum applied to the mold may also
be used to assist in the forming operation. Equipment may be similar in many
aspects to conventional plastic blow molding insofar as mold clamping action is
concerned with modification being provided to account for higher temperatures
and pressure required. Industry treating means for the sheet and/or

sheet to be shaped. J Lemelson TICKET COMPUTE March 28-63 A ticket issuing
machine and computer is conceived for use by ticket selling clerks for
railroads, airlines, and the like (viz- the many ticket clerks at Pennsylvania
Station for example). The system employs what will be defined as a unit ticket
or ticket unit which is provided on a roll of such units, preferably arranged in
duplicate or triplicate and automatically dispensed from a machine with
information already printed on each unit or string of said units in accordance
with the setting of a plurality of manually actuated or depressed or keep on a
console used by the issuing agent. The information printed on each ticket unit
at the time it is dispensed or issued is also automatically entered into a
computer in one form of the invention for record keeping purposes and EL 3/30/63

September 30, 1963. I have had little opportunity to continue work on the new
patent applications which I had been working on due to incapacitation, necessary
work on amendments, appeals, petitions, etc The following are a few of the
applications I will renew my work on. (Note - Sept 30-Dec 31, 1962 I was able to
perform little if any work due to total incapacitation. Jan. 1963, I was on a
recouperative vacation. Feb. and March 1963 were spent on amendments, appeals
and C.I.P. applications necessitated by the issuance or abandonment of other

devices (part of applications which I am preparing) to deposit, diffuse, plate
or otherwise dispose one material or materials into or onto another material for
forming new compounds, doping (semi-conductor) compounds, growing crystals,
welding, plating, etc; machining, creating chemical reactions, etc; testing
materials (analyzing contents, etc. Following are improvements conceived over

workpiece and/or x-ray analysis of the structure of the workpiece both occurring
either simultaneously when a (trigger) switch is closed, or selectively. Fig.1
In Fig.1 is shown a portable electron-beam device 10 comprising ~~ an ~~ housing

volume 17 within the housing against the workpiece. An electron beam gun or
x-ray generating unit 16 mounted within housing 12 and adapted, when energized,
to direct its beam 18 thru the aperture against the surface of the workpiece W
when an electric switch 15 is actuated when a trigger 16 thereof is pulled. The
switch 15 is monostable and is located ~~ near ~~ in the pistol grip portion 14
of the gun device 10. An opening 19 is provided thru the rim portion 12' of the
gun thru which air and/or a sampling of material vaporized from the surface of W
may be drawn. If the beam of the gun is to be generated in a vacuum, air may be
removed thru 19 and flexible line 20 connected to a vacuum pump. Notation 21
refers to a probe in the form of a scanner or sampling head adapted to analyze
the surface of W or the immediate volume surounding that area of the surface
intersected by the electron beam or x-ray beam. The end 21' of the probe 21 is
thus positioned immediately adjacent the spot area intersected by the beam 18.
The probe 21 may be operative to either electro-optically scan the area of W
intersected by the beam and/or withdraw vaporized molecules from the volume
adjacent said area for analysis by other means thru line 23. The ~~O ~~ device
10 may operate whereby, when the switch 15 is closed a controller such as a

rate from a hopper. Heated pellets of aluminium or other metal flow from the
hopper between two power driven drums 12 and 14, the exterior surfaces of each
of which are shaped with a plurality of projections or teeth disposed along the
length of each drum and adapted to fall between the side walls of the tooth-like
formations of the other drum (stations 13 and 16). The teeth do not mesh but
provide volumes 17 between the walls of each (see Fig. 2) which define the wall
thickness and shape of the resulting honeycomb cell or waffle-like sheet

JL 1/2/63 Apparatus and Method for Decorating Articles of Manufacture (Patent
application to be continuation-in-part of copending application entitled ) It is
conceived to decorate articles of manufacture such as molded plastic articles
(blow molded, injection molded, etc.) with multiple colors by the following
automatic process: (1) Preposition the article relative a means for generating a
first light pattern on the surface of the article after uniformly charging said
surface with a static electric field. (2) Project said first light pattern
against a predetermined. area of the article to create a charge pattern
according to the area(s) of the surface exposed to the light)(Electrons will be
repelled from the areas exposed to light; remain or gather in those areas not
exposed) (3) Dust or otherwise apply (such as by J Lemelson 1/2/63 THIS

Material such as used in the X-erox, Haloid Co. process) against the surface of
the article which particles are attracted to and remain against the ~~ charge ~~
areas of the surface which are oppositely charged and are repelled from areas of
similar charge. (4) Heat (by radiant or other heating means) the first colored
particle to cause them to melt and become bonded to the surface in the applied
pattern) (5) Cool by removing said heat and/or convection means to fuse the
melted particles as solid areas of said first color. (6) Recharge the surface of
the article to give it a uniform static electric JL 1/2/63 THIS CONFIDENTIAL

Blow Molded Container & Method of Making It is conceived to produce a blow
molded box or bottle with an integrally molded cover, top or cap. In particular,
the container may be used to house such products as cigarettes(20 pack), cigars,
candy, etc. The method is applicable to the production of one piece, liquid
container also. A small rectangular box such as a cigarette box shape is

thin, sheet like plastic walls including a front wall 12, top wall 13, bottom
wall 14, rear wall 15 and side walls 16 and 17 which form a totally enclosed box
like container, after blow molding. The front wall 12 of the container 10 is
defined by an upper portion 12a and a lower portion 12b separated by a channel
like indicated formation 12c. CM 3/6/63

metal spinning have been conceived. I. A method of spin forming a sheet or tube
of metal (or plastic or ceramic) comprising ~~ plac ~~ spin forming the metal to
a first shape in a lathe type fixture and thereafter drawing the metal while
spinning. Drawing may be effected by means of (a) moving a mandrel
longitudinally and axially against the spinning sheet after or during spin
forming or (b) in the case of a tube being spun to shape while the ends of the
tube are held in respective rotating chucks or fixtures, by power driving said
chucks or fixtures apart, preferably while a tool is depressed against the
surface of the spinning tube as to permit the metal EL 4/18/63

### Page 46
spin together to close & pour in metal onto plug

to draw out. Control of the movement and force exerted by the chucks in movement
away from each other as well as the force, location, and movement (radially as
well as longitudinally) of the tool or tools depressed against the tubing as it
spins, may be automatic in accordance with a program or other means. Control may
also be effected by means of feedback signals compared with recorded reference
signals and derived by optically or otherwise measuring the diameter of the
spinning part at the tool, the wall thinness thereof, the forces applied to the
tool, etc. II Form an article such as a drinking cup, pitcher, etc. by spinning
a length of tubing and reducing a portion of its length with a EL 4/18/63

plug or rod disposed within the tubing whereby the spinning causes the wall of
the tubing to be deformed against (and possibly spin welded) against the plug or
rod. Champaign glasses forming of metal effects may be so derived in metal

continuously cast metal moving an an inert atmosphere, to a molten conditions
and thereafter employing one or more of the following to cause the metal (or
other material) to atomize or vaporize). (a) employing a rapidly expanding and
collapsing internal magnetic filed in the vicinity (around the end of the
melting rod or billet to cause the melted material to ~~ at ~~ form tiny

droplets away from the end. (c) magnetostrictively vibrating the rod or
continuous casting by coupling it to a source of magnetostrictive energy. (d)
Moving the end of the melting rod (just above the melted portion) against a
vibrating member such as a transducer. (e) striking the melting metal with a
pulsed light beam or an electron beam of sufficient energy to cause the metal
melting to atomize or vaporize. Methods and Apparatus For Continuously Extruding
Metal. The following steps are involved (Process#1) (a) Continuously form
pellets of metal such as aluminum (for example, by Reynold's metals technique of
pouring aluminum into a rapidly CM 4/28/63

### Page 57
rotating drum (e) The pelets are then screened, and reheated to a temperature
near the molten range of the metal - Thereafter, one or more of several
techniques may be employed to continuously extrude the pellets to a
predetermined shape. viz. I Pellets are fed to an extrusion screw at a flow rate
sufficient to permit said screw to force the pellets thru a die to form an
extrusion thereof Pellets may be heated in the extrude to a semi-molten state to
facilitate extrusion. Cut-off of lengths of the extrusion is on-the-fly. Screw
may reciprocate as it rotates to compact the pellets into a solid metal mass in
advance of the die. Employment of an intense expanding and collapsing magnetic
filed around in in the extrusion EL 4/23/63 CM 4/28/63

chamber may also solidify and densify the pellets into a solid extrudable mass.
II Pellets are fed to an extrusion chamber and are forced thru a die opening in
said chamber by a ram or piston. Piston advances toward die and retracts after
full forward motion permitting new charge of (heated) pellets - to enter
extrusion chamber in advance of ~~ it ~~ piston. Process repeats. Induction
energy applied to chamber and/or die heats charge and/or maintains temperature
of the end of ~~ the process ~~ what is left of the prior charge so that new
slug formed by a new charge unites with the remaining portion of the old charge
or slug. to form a single extrusion. Die may also be heated. CM 4/28/63

### Page 58
III Pellets are alternately charged first into one extrusion chamber (while the
other is extruding metal) then into the other. A valving means between the two
alternately feeds metal first from one and the other chamber to the die (and/or
~~ the ~~ a third chamber immediately in front of the die. Valving means may
comprise a rotating die plate. IV Pellets are fed downward between rollers which
are shaped to both roll and extrude the metal into various structural shapes
such as beams, channels, tubing, etc. Other rollers may be employed to further
shape the metal formed in the first rollers. V Pellets are automatically EL
4/23/63 CM 4/28/63

formed and fed to a plurality of impact extrusion dies. More than enough metal
is employed and excess metal is forced out of the die and recycled. VI A new
method and apparatus for forming metal sheet (such as aluminum) is conceived as
follows: (A.) Aluminum in molten state is poured at a predetermined rate ~~ to
~~ onto a ~~ rapidly ~~ moving closed loop belt (the upper surface thereof) such
as a sheet of stainless ~~ stea ~~ steel and retained on the belt by bowing the
belt downward in the center viz

(B) As the belt moves along, ~~ the bow ~~ horizontally, the bow gradually
    decreases (by roller means guiding the belt, the metal spreads out thereon
    and solidifies as it cools. Cool air or other fluid is 4/28/63 CM

### Page 59
directed against the underface of the belt to increase solidifying rate. The
metal may then be stripped off the belt and used per se or may be passed
therefrom or therewith thru rolls of a rolling mill to roll it to size. The same
technique may be employed to form plastic sheet from molten plastic or powdered
plastic introduced onto a heated (and later cooled) belt. The moving  (and
cooled) belt apparatus may be used to convey liquid metal from a furnace to
other casting or forming means.

characteristics of the semi-molten material comprising 15. Film portions 15'
between portions 15W may be caused to outwardly bulge by vacuum applied to the
areas of the drum between the die ridges or the warpage of 15. If sheet 15 is a
sheet of self foaming (polystyrene, etc) cellular plastic which is in the act of
foaming as it is extruded, the volume 17 may be filled with foamed plastic such
a cellular polystyrene, urethane, etc and the contour defined by surface 14' may
be derived without the need to vacuum or pressure form 15. If sheet 11 is porous

pouches, of plastic film with a liquid to provide frozen ice pops, cubes, or
other shapes of ice and the like for coin operated sales: General Description of
Machine & Operation 1. One or more roles of plastic film are provided in the
machine for dispensing a heat sealed strip of connected oblong plastic pouches
which extend laterally across the strip coming from the roll 2. Motor driven
guide and driven means engage the plastic pouch strip and feed it past a filling
device which contains an injector needle which injects a predetermined quantity
of liquid to be frozen into each pouch as it passes the filling station. A heat
sealing machine (optional) seals the hole created by the needle of the filling
injector 3. The still connected filled pouch is next driven through a freezing
chamber preferably containing thermoelectric freezing elements in which it may
be detained until ready to be dispensed. W 4. Upon insertion of a coin into the
machine and operation of a flavor selector, the end (filled and frozen) pouch of
the strip of pouches is

EL 5/23/63

### Page 25
severed from the strip by means of a cutting knife operated by a solenoid and
drops by gravity down a dispensing chute. Features and advantages of the machine
include: A. By providing concentrated sugar- flavor liquid or tablet mixes which
are automatically dispensed into a reservoir to provide a quantity of the liquid
(fruit-bar) to be frozen, the need for supplying large quantities of the liquid
product is eliminated - the machine merely need be connected to a water supply
and provided with automatic valves and controls to effect mixing of the
concentrated fruit or sugar juice prior to filling pouches therewith B. Use of
flat pouches in roll strip form ~~ permit ~~ plus liquid or powder concentrate
provides a large stock of the product to greatly increase the time between
machine filling. C. If the pouches are each pre-charged or contain ~~ powder ~~
small quantities of powder or liquid juice or sugar flavored mixture in
concentrated form, then it will only be necessary to inject water into each
pouch and agitate prior freezing.

EL 5/23/63

### Page 26
D. If it is desired to dispense connected, pre-filled pouches of juice bars
which are frozen in the machine, then the filled pouches may be guided and
driven by engagement of flat border strips at each end of the pouch
(longitudinal borders of the pouch strip) preferably containing a hole on each
border strip aligned with each pouch for sprocket drive thereof. The pouch strip
may be stored in a convoluting manner in a path thru which the strip will
automatically feed when first loaded after the strip is started by the service
man. Self threading strip may also apply to unfilled strip. (E) A BLOWER blowing
air thru the refrigerating zone may be used to cool the rest of the chamber
containing filled but not frozen pouches. (F) Control of filling may be effect
automatically by a counter whereby a batch or number of pouches are filled at a
time. Thus the end of the unfilled strip of pouches may be severed from a
predetermined number of filled pouches which are selectively dispensed
thereafter (G) Such a machine as described EL 5/23/63

### Page 27
may be incorporated within a conventional ice dispensing machine for dispensing
ice or ice pops or in a milk machine. (H) With the proper agitator and liquid
mixture, the machine may be used to fabricate pouches containing sherbets also.
(I) Pouches may be fabricated from film rolls (in the machine) or from apparatus
for extruding film or pouches. (J) The pouches may be filled with water which is
frozen to produce ice for dispensary in cube form. The ice may also be chipped
or crushed as it is prefrozen  and filled as such in the pouches which are
folded or heat sealed thereafter. (K) Crushed fruit, frozen vegetables, frozen
soups, desserts, etc. may be similarly dispensed as above from either strips of
pre-filled pouches (which are pre-frozen or frozen in the vending machine) or
are filled in the vending machine from reservoirs of said materials best at
frozen temperature. The advantages of loading in the vending machine include (a)
less time required to load

SCANNING SYSTEM It is conceived to effect more efficient transmission of
facsimile information over telephone lines as follows: (a) Utilize a dual system
of scanning rate. Control to scan a particular image field, that is provide a
first osculator system at both sender and receiver to which is operative to
drive both the read-beam of the video camera at the sending station and the
write beam of the video receiver at the sending station at a first speed and a
second oscillator a beam sweep speed control means at both sending and receiving
stations which is operative to drive the beams at a much higher speed. (b)
Automatically sense by scanning or other means the presence of an area lens in
the path of the picture or image field scanning beam of the camera prior to
arrival of said image field scanning beam threat. The area so sensed may be any
image intensity which is other than a white or redundant background and may be
sensed by a second beam or the leading edge of the scanning beam. sensing WW

### Page 104
may be effected by clipping the picture signal generated by the scanning beam
above or below a certain intensity, (frequency or amplitude)level and generating
a signal therefrom which is utilized to switch the output of the slow or fast
rate oscillator to control the beam sweep speed both at the sending and
receiving stations. In other words, both read and write beams are caused to scan
slow (or at conventional 30 frame/second speed) ~~ which ~~while scanning image
information which is not ~~ no ~~of predetermined intensity such as either white

30 frames/sec. speed or more) while scannning redundant field information (white
or black background)which field intensity is ~~ab~~ automatically genterated at
the receiver by automatic means if necessary. When the sensing beam no longer
senses an image area of a predetermined intensity or intensity range the lack of
an output signal therefrom is utilized to gate( by use of a monostable switch in
the output of the fast rate oscillator circuit driving the beam)the output of
the ~~ slow~~fast rate of oscillator to drive ~~the ~~ both beams at said EJW

faster rate. The sensing signal is thus not only generated at the scanning
camera and used to control the speed of the read beam thereof but is also
transmitted to the receiver station and used to and control the speed of
write-beam of the video picture tube (image tube) thereat so that the position
of both beams will always be in synchronized relationship to each other
regardless of how the read beam is speeded up or slowed down during scanning a
particular field - In other words the sensing signal is used to sync the
position and speed of sweep of the write beam with that of the read beam as well
as to effect control of the speed or rate of scanning of the two beams. It is
noted that the two oscillator systems must be synced to each other with the fast
sweep oscillator control generating line vertical sync signals at a frequency
which is a multiple of the frequency of that in which the slow rate oscillator
operates or the operation may be such that the fast sweep oscillator is only
operative to control the speed of the beam sweep and not line frequency which is
controlled either by a separate oscillator or the slow sweep oscillator
circuits. If the image field contains a line image of a particular intensity

to sync same to the operation of both.

HIGHWAY CONE & LIGHT Aug. 15-63 I visited (United Telecontrol, Inc. (Belmar
N.J., Monmouth Airport) and discussed my U.S. Patent # 2949531 with Harold Sher
and Gus Schmeling to determine if they would be interested in developing a model
for me: Amongst the improvements I suggested to them were the following which I
intended to develop & file for one or more patents on: (a) Mold or fasten a
metal ring or cylinder to the neck of the rubber cone and ring adapted to serve
as a mount for the housing containing the light, lens and battery and attached
in either a locked or assembled to permit use of a key or wrench to be used to
lock the housing in place so that it cannot easily be taken off the cone
(without the key) and can be quickly disassembled by means of the key or wrench.
Some sort of removable pin or wedge perhaps spring loaded or moved by turning
parts to engage & release the housing may suffice. (b) Provide hermetic sealing
for the assembled housing and for a quick connection to the rechargeable battery
therein. (c) Provide (formed with any plastic) to shock mount the light source,
battery & circuits in the housing. I also mentioned to Harold Sher that I have a
patent pending for a JC-8/16/63 EW 9/17/63

15, 1963 Apparatus and Method for Continuously casting (or extruding) metal and
continuously coating or treating the shape so cast or extruded as it experiences
from the mold or die. viz. I. Continuously cast or extrude hollow shapes such as
pipe and introduce the coating material as a liquid or powder through the
mandrel (and/or an extension thereof extending some distance into the interior
of the shape being cast or extruded) in a manner to cause said material to form
the desired coating on the inside surface of the pipe. Note: the mandrel or a
portion thereof, determines the shape of the interior of the casting. Depending
also after it is drawn on the characteristics of the coating material and how it
is conveyed to the exhaust end of the mandrel, the interior of the mandrel may
have to contain jacketing or conduit means for moving a heat transfer fluid
therethru to prevent volatizing or burning said coating LW 9/8/63 JC - 8/16/63

(coat outside) Material. The continuous casting die or mold may also have to be
water cooled (if casting or extruding steel or other metal which will otherwise
be at a temperature so high when it passes the end of the mandrel or extension
thereof thru which coating material is introduced as to prevent desired coating
from forming. In other words, the temperature of the casting is so controlled by
heat transfer to the die or mold and casting itself (air or liquid blown there
against) so that, when the coating material (plastic, chromate, or any other) is
applied thereto, the surface to which it is applied will be at the correct
temperature for best results. If thermoplastic plastic is sprayed from the
mandrel or extension as a powder, solution or molten spray against the inside
surface of the  pipe as it extrudes or is formed to shape as in casting, the
temperature of the surface receiving said plastic is preferably  just above the
melting point of the plastic (300 degrees F to 500 degrees F for most plastics).
The coating material may also be extrusion coated onto the inside surface of the
pipe from the mandrel. It may also comprise ceramic or metal sprayed onto the
inside surface of the moving casting as a molten liquid or powder. Powdered
aluminum, for example, may be introduced thru the mandrel and applied as a spray
or flurdized mass flurdizing taking place by also JC - 8/16/63 LW 9/8/63 THIS

introducing a gas thru the mandrel) against the inside surface of a hollow hot
steel extrusion or casting which is at a temperature such that the aluminum
powder will be caused to melt on said surface as an integral coating of uniform
thickeners. The gas may be next so as not to oxidize the surface of the steel
and may also be used to convey the powder: Powdered glass or ceramic materials
may also be applied to the inside surface of the pipe by spray. If fluidization
of powder is used, pipe may be horizontally or upwardly cast permitting
fluidization or so disposed when powder is introduced. (i.e extension of mandrel
may be bent to ~~ fo ~~ conform to shape of extrusion) and temperature of the
casting is such as to cause the powder to melt and fuse with a uniform coating.
Curtain powdered or liquid materials may also be flame sprayed against the
interior surface of the casting (by mounting flame spraying head on mandrel or
extension thereof and feeding flame spraying (s) ~~ th ~~ as well as coating
material thru mandrel) Exterior surface(s) of casting or extrusion may also be
coated as discribed above, as it casts or extrudes when at the right temperature
by passing thru a container of fluidized particles, liquid or by being sprayed
thereagainst. Reheating of THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ AND UNDERSTOOD BY E. W.

article. Particles of material which does not melt on the surface of the article
may be retained in a coating defined by the vaporized metal or other material

its qualities also ex. & collapse extrusion die, etc compress or inwardly deform

to cause inward deformation of the mold wall. (b) In a second technique, a band,
frame or portion of the mold is made of paramagnetic material and is
magnetically deformed (below the elastic limit thereof) to react against the
mold wall and inwardly deform it against the molded piece. (c) In a third
technique, the molded part itself is caused to expand and/or contract by
generating an intense magnetic field in or around the mold (or die) to cause
working of the molded or extruded piece. (d) In a fourth technique, a large
force is applied with an actuator to the wall of the mold or die (either as a
constant/and/or intermittent force) to cause it to compress the molded piece or
extrusion prior to its removal therefrom No permanent deformation occurs. (e) In

minimum by only engaging the tape with the reproduction transducer when it is in
line with or positioned just in advance of the frame selected to be reproduced

concept of applying one colored plastic as a thin strip or strips to extruded or
blown plastic (of another color) film in order to decorate same or to reinforce
same. He said it could be done and I expressed the opinion that there would be a
substantial market for such a product. I also suggested that perhaps the
striping device or extruder could be operated in the manner as taught in my
patent to limit the length of decorative strips by programmed stoppage and
restart of flow of the decorative material. It is also conceived by me to
provide a net-like decoration on film by oscillating or rotating portions of the
extrusion die thru which the decorating meterial is flowing to form a
lattice-like array of bands of a different color or material than the base film
which bands criss-cross each other on either or both surfaces of the film Fig. 1

spraying or flowing metal onto the filaments as they are wound which may be
accomplished per se or with the addition of that provided by passing the

Filaments and crystals of high temperature materials may also be formed by
directing an intense laser (coherent) generated light beam against a rod or
powdered material as it is fed to a die so as to melt the material entering the
die and drawing said material or forcing it thru the die. Only that material in
the immediate vicinity of the die is melted and may be drawn or forced thru the
die by magnetic means and/or by oscillating the rod or other shape feeding the
material. The narrow electron or light beam may be intermittently generated in a
vacuum surrounding the die each time a ram compacting the material thru the die
retracts. Jerome Lemelson Material from p 267 to this point read & understood by

Casting of Metal It is conceived to continuously cast or extrude a first metal
or non metal as a tube or thereafter to continuously cast the same or different
metal or non-metal theron for post-application.This may greatly increase the
rate of continuous casting metal shapes since the casting rate is not dependant
on the ability of the cast metal to solidify in a mold and the extruded outer
shell may actually contain molten metal which may be cooled therein by spraying
water against

either depositing an insulating material such as magnesium, oxide, al oxide,
titanium oxide, or fluorides of metals such as these or by depositing a layer of
metal and completely converting same to an oxide, fluoride, etc or by converting
the exposed surface of the sensing element to an oxide by exposure, for example,
to Hydrogen fluoride gas, etc. Plating and heat or beam etching technique may be
applied to the above procedures. Also signal generated by strain gage or
thermocouple may be capacitatively inductively transferred to another circuit by
providing a deposited inductor in circuit with the strain or thermocouple

Also proposed to Joe Lieberman and Sam Freimauer yesterday, Jan 24 was the  idea
of molding different size housings to accommodate records of different diameters
(i.e. a housing larger than they are now planning to produce for sale to doll
manufacturers so that a larger record may be used for use of the unit in a
mechanical toy, game or larger doll) The following improvements and
modifications in the Frey crank record player are conceived by me and will be
proposed to Mr's Freemauer and Lieberman to reduce the costs thereof and improve
its performance. In return, I expect to be paid a royalty for any and all units
sold and incorporation the  changes proposed hereafter or on page 31. I.
Fabrication of speaker unit itself. Frey's current speaker is pressed fiber

urethane polymer (Seclon), Celcon, ABS, etc plastic) or to form same from thin
sheet by known or modified thermoforming techniques. These structures, methods
and apparatus for producing an audio speaker may be patentable and I intend to
file patent applications, if so: (A) Thermoformed speaker and/or diaphragm
therefore. Since the diaphragm is relatively thin and its support or frame
heavier, it is conceived to thermoform a sheet of thermoplastic ( into a cavity
in a mold the shape of the diaphragm while restraining the sheet material
adjacent the cavity from flowing therein. Thus the central portion of the sheet
which flows into the cavity will thin out but the rim of the speaker diaphragm
remains the same thickness JC - 1/24/64 THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ AND

the sheet may be engaged and held by a circular restrainer die against the face
of the mold to prevent its flow into the mold cavity. The rim may also be
beaded, corrugated or otherwise formed during thermoforming the diaphragm or
later reinforced by attaching it to a molded frame, etc. II Entire diaphragm,

Theft Identification by electronics It is conceived to provide a simple

of emitting a binary digital code or particular frequency signal whenever its
input is pulsed with a current and to use said device attached to an article or

which will generate a different code or tone identifying signal than all other
code or tone generators in use. The ~~code~~identifying signal(s) may be
generated periodically at all times (during the life of the battery which may be
years) or while the engine is running. (b) The identifying signal generator is
preferably located where it cannot easily be silenced or pampered with. A good
location may be in a housing containing a part vital to the operation of the
vehicle such that removal of the housing, part or device will prevent operation
of the vehicle or will not be easily accomplished. Placement of THIS
