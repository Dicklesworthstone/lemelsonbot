January 28, 1959 To whom it may concern On this date, January 28, 1959 I visited
Kaysam Corporation, Paterson, N.J. My former employer with the intent of
determining if they would be helpful to me in producing models of squeeze and
novelty toy ideas I have consented for products made of dry molded latex and/or
rotational or slush molded vinyl or the like. The basic ideas which I sketched
and described to both Carl Hotstein and Abe Duncan are hereby recorded primarily
because, after describing them to Duncan, he discussed my problem with Mr.
Ernest Gelles, president of the company without asking me if he should do so. He
told me that he had informed Gelles that I had some new ideas in squeeze toys
but did not go into the exact details. However, Carl Hotstein later remarked to
me that Abe Duncan cannot be trusted to maintain confidence. Basically the
designs evolve about a toy having a central body member or portion made out of a
dipped latex bellows, bellows or a rotational or slushed molded bellows portion.
A design is illustrated on page 7 consists of a toy (squeeze novelty, crib or
play toy) having a body with three portions, an upper body portion 12, a central
body portion 14 which is shaped like a bellows which extends at its lower end to
a lower body portion 16 or stand which may be molded integral with 14 or secured
thereto the tower end of 14 or of 16 may be secured to a Lenore Waldmeyer Jan

clamp, suction cup or other device for securing it to a surface, railing or part
of a crib or handle. The bellows is of such a characteristic that it will
ordinarily remain in the expanded state and support the upper body portion 12
but may be easily deflected to collapse or squeeze together and create a noise
by expelling air thru an opening 18 (such as at the bottom wall) having a
noisemaker therin. Reference is may to my copending application entitled
noisemaking Toys and particularly to Figs. 20 and 21 for details of this
construction in the fabrication of a bellows noisemaker. Jerome Lemelson Jan 28

August. 4. 1959 Record of Conception: The following product and packaging ideas
will be incorporated into patent application and will, in the coming months, be
delivered to Johnson and Johnson. I. Brush Covering - This was conceived a
number of years ago and the patent specification (first draft) worked out last
winter. It consists of several novel designs for ~~ pla ~~ covers for the
bristles or tufts of various types of brushes. The covers are preferably molded
of plastic and snap over or screw onto a formed section of the brush base
adjacent the bristle. II. Single Shot (liquid, cream, or powder) Dispensers It
has been conceived by me to provide a low cost dispenser or package for flowable
material for possibly for a single application of a liquid such as an
antiseptic, nose drops, face cream, ointment, burn salv oil (baby oil, ~~ it ~~
machine oil), medicine (spray), ~~ or the like ~~ powder or the like. These
dispensers are preferably made of plastic (from 2 heat sealed sheets (.001 to
.005 " thick) or thin walled tubing Conceived designs as follows

Fig.1 and 2 illustrates one form of the invention which comprises a package or
closure which is made from sheet material and is adapted for the rapid ~~ and ~~
dispensing of a predetermined quantity of a flowable material such as a liquid,
cream or powder. The closure is preferably made of a flattened tube or two
sheets of plastic material, metal foil or laminates Read & UNDERSTOOD By J.B.

of the two and consists of a pouch 12 in which said flowable material is
hermetically sealed, which pouch is fabricated and filled preferably by
automatic machinery from the flattened plastic tube 10 or assembly of abutted
sheets of foil or plastic material. The pouch portion 12 is shown having an
enlarged reservoir section 14 for storing most if not all of the contents which
extends to an elongated section or neck 16 of substantially smaller
cross-section than 14. The neck portion 16 ~~ serves ~~ may be provided for
dispensing the contents of 12 and ~~ may be used used for dispensing the ~~
control of the direction of flow of said contents which will flow therethru when

is squeezed between the fingers ~~ and ~~ after the wall of the neck is torn or
penetrated. ~~ to perm The illustrated pouch 12 is made from a length 11 of the
material comprising the elongated strips or tube 10 which length may be severed
therefrom after the formation and filling of 12 or may ~~ l ~~ remain ~~ in ~~

Formations in tandem array. The notation 24 refers to a perforation or partial
die-cut, extending laterally across 10, which may be provided to permit the
sections 11 to be severed from the rest of the strip when needed for use. A
strip heat-seal or weld 18 extends around the pouch ~~ formation ~~ 12 which
effects the formation of the pouch. The notation 18a refers to that portion of
the seal extending around the reservoir portion 14 of the pouch and 18b to the
sealing line extending adjacent the neck portion 16. Filling the pocket with
material may be effected ~~ thru ~~ across the area of the seal such as at the
end 18c' of 18c which Read & Understood by Jacob B. Gilstein Sept. 5, 1959

### Page 7
may be left open after sealing portions 18a, 18b and 18c are formed. A filling
nozzle may be automatically inserted across 18c  18c' into the neck 16 or across
any other portion of the seal 18 after which the liquid is injected, the nozzle
removed and the area (18c') automatically welded or sealed off. ~~ Hee ~~ If it
is desired to utilize the closure 12 for dispensing a small quantity and/or
predetermined amount of a liquid or cream into a cavity such as the ~~ nose ~~
nostril, the nose portion 16 is preferably provided narrow enough to effect said
insertion and the material of 10 on both sides of 16, referred to by the
notation 10a and 10b, is preferably removed by die-cutting. A semi-circular
die-cut such as 22 may suffice to provide 16 in a small enough cross-section for
insertion into its intended cavity. To dispense the material held in 12, the
wall thereof must be severed and this may be accomplished in one of several
manners. While the end of nose 16 may be cut off with an implement such as a
scissors, if the container is to be carried on a person for use when the need
arises, it is preferable that a simpler method of opening the nose wall be
provided. Quick opening may be effected in one of a number of manners. The ~~
melt ~~ opening means illustrated in Fig. 11 utilizes the tearing of the
material of one wall of 16 by means of a tear strip 20 which is a narrow band of
flexible or rigid plastic, 3/32 to 1/4 inches wide, which preferably has a
tensile strength greater than that of the material of the wall of 16. In Fig. 1
the tear strip 20 is shown welded or heat sealed to the outer surface of ~~ the
~~ one wall of 16, which weld is provided in a manner such that when the tear
strip is pulled upward from 16 or longitudinally relative to 16, a small Read

tear-opening at the weld ~~ 18c' ~~ 20w will be effected in the wall of 16 thru
which the contents of 12 may be forced by squeezing the walls of 14 together
between the fingers and/or by gravity. The tear strip 20 may be applied across
each nose formation as a continuous strip of material by means of respective
spot welds 2OW applied with ~~ a ~~ ~~ s ~~ heated dies or electronic heat
sealing dies which welds may be effected prior to or after the formation of the
enclosures (i.e. ~~ prior to o ~~ by spot welding the strip 20 to one wall of
the container or across both walls of the neck portion 16, which would tack the
walls of the neck portion together. The notation 20c refers to respective cuts
in the tear strip material which provide it in a plurality of sections, one for
each of the closure formations. The closures 12 may be individually severed from
the strip 10 along the lines indicated at 12 ~~ by ~~ or may be torn therefrom
as used if it is desired to provide the closures in an elongated strip or in a
roll formation. The provision of perforations or scores in the sheets along line
24 will facilitate severing the individual lengths of material by tearing.
Further variations in the closure design include:

Electric Razor Design Monitone Universal HOLLOW TUBULAR CYLINDER Oct. 9, 1959

Fig. 1 Figs 1 illustrates in partial cross-section details of the improved
electric razor head in partial cross-section. The razor 10 has a molded plastic
casing 12 of conventional design and made in two or more parts assembled with
fasteners with internally mounted components secured to said housery and
consisting of a rechargable battery 27 which is electrically connected thru an
externally operative switch 30 to a d.c. motor 25 for operating the cutting
components of the razor. The shaft 25' of motor 25 is coupled to a gear train 24
having an output or drive gear 24'. The motor, battery and gear train are ~~
separded from ~~ secured is separated from the head section 11 of the razor by
means of a wall or partition 26. Cutting is accomplished by means of a rotary
cutter 22 which is a thin walled cylinder, preferably made from stainless steel
~~ or ~~ tubing having a wall thickness less than .015 inches. Force filled into
the end portions of the cyclinder 22 are shaft pins 16 and 21. The ends of these
pins are supported in rotational bearing by means of bearings 15 and 20 which

Gilstein Nov 1, 1959 Record of Conception Some time prior to this date I have
conceived of the method and apparatus for providing printed decorations on blow
molded plastic articles by printing on the sheet or sheet of plastic from which
the article is made, then heating it to ~~ near ~~ formable state as it feeds
between mold halves without destroying printing, registering it in adjacent mold
halves and closing mold halves when in registration while blowing the sheets
outward with air. The printing may be effected on either those surfaces which
form the inside or outside of the article. A photoelectric relay scanning the LW
11/13/59 EJW 11/13/59

printing (positional marks) may be used to effect longitudinal registration of
printed matter. Jerome H Lemelson

### Page 12
Nov 6, 1959 Concerning the above idea, an edge line or lines ~~ scann ~~ printed
on the sheet or sheets of plastic to be blow molded may be used for lateral
registration. The correction of the position of a photoelectric cell (error
signal derived in change in position when ~~ fo ~~ the motor driving the mount
for the cell laterally to maintain it in alignment with said line) may be used
to shift either the means guiding the sheets to align it with the mold or shift
the mold in a lateral position so that the printed matter on the sheet will be
exactly registered in the molded product. To protect the printed matter from
distortion when the sheet is blown into the mold, it may be provided between the
surface of one or both sheets. One method of providing it between surfaces is to
coat or laminate the same or other (sheet) material on the printed surface of
the sheet or to provide said printed illustration on the inside surface of the
sheet laminated thereto. Another method is to utilize a sheet of plastic in
white a photographic image has been reproduced and blow mold this material after
carefully heating to semi-molten state. Here are several article ideas which
together with the above, I intend to file patent application on. Imitation
Stained Glass Window

The window 1 and possibly the frame or part of the frame is made of a lamination
of ~~ a lamination ~~ of a first plastic sheet 2 (may be rigid vinyl on the
thermostatic) (over) LW 11/13/59 EJW 11/13/59

### Page 13
.025 to .010 inches in thickness having a second sheet 3 (~~ .0005 to .002"
thick)of a highly durable plastic material such as polyvinyl fluoride bonded and
laminated to the outside surface of 1, the outer surface 3' of 3 being that
which is exposed to the atmosphere. A multi-colored transparent or translucent
design (simulating a stained glass window pattern) may be provided at the
interface 4 between 2 and 3 by printing with translucent or transparent ink on
either the inside face of 4 or the outside face of 2. The notation 2b refers to
a vacuum  or ? ~~ formed or molded ridge formation in the sheet 2 or assembly 1
simulating the metal joining the sections of stained glass and the illustration
4" printed at the interface 4 is preferably black material to simulated the iron
metal which joins sections of stained glass in a window frame. The inside
surface 2' of 2 may or may not be coated with a protective plastic layer such as
acrylonitrile plastic or PVT film itself The above lamination and decorative
means may be applied to windows of any design  and it is conceived that many new
and interesting shapes may be provided. For example, the ribbed formation 2b may
have different shapes and may be limited in its length. It may represent a jewel
sch as a ruby or saphire (its shape being integrally molded or vacuum formed and
color being derived by printng on the inside face 2' of 2, or at the interface 4
between 2 and 3, either on the inside of 3 or outside of 2. A structure is
conceived for a lenticular display sign to be used out of doors ref. being made
to my LW 11/13/59 EJW 11/13/59

pending applications "DISPLAY DEVICE" and display and Manufacture Thereof" viz.

The display at right consists of a laminated assembly 1 of a rigid (or flexible)
base sheet 2 of any suitable plastic, metal or lamination. An assembly 3 or
lamination of several sheets is preferably hermetically secured or bonded with
an adhesive to one surface of 2 and consists of a lenticular or ribbed sheet 4
of transparent plastic having a multiplicity of semi-cylindrical formations or
ribs 4 formed by extrusion or molding or vacuum forming in one surface thereof
(may also be semi-spherical or the like) Bonded to the outside (ribbed) surface
of 4 is a transparent sheet or film of a durable plastic such as polyvinyl
fluoride (preferably .001 inches or .0005" to .0001" thick depending on shape of
ribs 4) which protects outer surface of (rigid vs flexible viny chloride)sheet 4
from abrasion or weathering. Bonded to other surface of 4 is a second sheet 3'
of P.V.F. or other material, there being the desired multi-pattern display
printed at the interface 3" either on surface of 3' or 4. The sheet 3' may also
be Scotch Lite material or may be eliminated if base sheet 2 (.03 to .250"
thick) has illustration thereon or is hermetically laminated to 4 which base
sheet may be sheet of Scotch Lite The following method of packaging springs
(coil or other) has been conceived by me. It is conceived to guide the short LW

length of coil spring as or just after its formation and exit from the wire coil
or bending machine and to deposit it directly onto an elongated sheet of folded
paper or plastic to which it is secured or against which it is held (and
prevented from becoming entangled with other springs). ~~ and thereby ~~ If the
plastic strip is wrapped or folded around the springs (in a tube-like formation)
or a second sheet of plastic or paper is secured or bonded over the first sheet
or strip with the spring there between, then the tubular-like formation may be
rolled into coils and present the springs in an orderly manner to the ~~ user ~~
user who may intermittently feed said tubular formation into a machine adapted
to easily handle the prepositioned springs automatically in assembling a product
using one or more of the springs - The ~~ trick ~~ trick is to transfer the
spring as soon as it is formed from the forming machine to the paper or plastic
(sheet(s)or tubular formation and operate to secure them in an orderly and
predetermined position therein. Several packaging cross-sections would appear as
follows.

thru a feeding machine and may be used in coiling the package or in performing
other handling. The inner edge C of flange(s) D may be slit automatically to
remove each spring individually as the package is advanced or a slit C' may be
effected longitudinally in the wall 2 of the package or laterally as at C"
between those portions of the package containing the springs in a manner to
expose the end of the spring. Both packaging machine and a machine (apparatus)
for automatically removing the springs from the elongated tubular package are
conceived.

sheet or sheets 13a and 13b are shown fed from supply rolls 14 and 16 and
eventually and up in a tubular formation 13d which may be fed into a roll or
coil formation 22 on a drum or reel 22'. The individual coil springs SN, SN+1,

therein is feed thru a stitching or heat sealing gluing or fastening machine 19
which either laterally and longitudinally seals the sheets together in a manner
to fix the positions of the springs (forms pockets or welds the sheets to
prevent longitudinal movement of the springs S so they may be automatically
removed from said tubular formation

at an assembly machine may be accomplished by apparatus such as illustrated in
Fig. 2 which apparatus, incidentally may be used for the removal of any tubular
product of limited length from a tubular package of the type provided on p. 19.
The tubed package 13d is continuously or intermittently fed from a feed drum or
box (not shown) by means of rolls 51, and 51' one of which is powered between a
pair of guide rolls 52 and the sheet material of 13d is slit by means of one or
more stationery or rotating blades 54 mounted adjacent the moving pacage. An
elongated rod 55 passes into the package in a position whereby the individual
coil springs S are carried thereon and pushed along 55 as the tubular package
13d" moves forward. The rod 55 is supported near one end as it rests against the
springs which rest against the lower portion of the slit package which rides
against the power rotated drum 53. The other end of 55 is supported by a
combination of movable mechanisms. A first support 56 has arms 57 and 57' which
slidably engage the bottom surface of 55 and

operates in a sliding movement to remove the end spring from the end of 55 and
carries it onto one arm (shown as 62) of an intermittently rotatable, indexing
fixture 60 shown containing 4 other arms 61, 63 and 64. An advancing pin 65

advance the springs ~~ and to ~~ onto mod 55 to keep them apart and prevent them
from bunching up. 56 must be lowered prior to its return so that the end of 57'
clears the next spring and this is effected by means of a a second cylinder 67

formed by passing the laminate 10 thru the suitable rotating heated dies Which
permanently deform both the foam plastic layer and covering of PVF 14' fusing
the material of 14 as at 14a into a more dense framed or solid mass to retain
the irregular shape. The combination of 14 and 16 may be shaped per se or a
combination with 12. The shape ~~ d ~~ of the exterior surface of the panel 10
may also be effected by providing a sheet or layer 17 of flexible or rigid vinyl
or other plastic (such as polyethylene.) bonded to the surface 14' and ~~ hav~~
embossed or otherwise irregularly externally shaped on its outer surface 17' to
which is secured a coating on thin sheet 16' of ~~ PF ~~ polyvinylflouride ~~ 16
~~. The PVF, if a sheet may be bonded to 17 prior to the irregular external
shaping after which both flexible base 17 and 16 are embossed or shapped in a
heated die. If 16 is applied as a spray (dispersion of P.V.F. microparticles in
a bonder or solvent sprayed on- may be subject of patent application), then the
surface of 17 or 14 may have been preshaped or molded with the desired design
therein. On Fig. 3, the laminated panel 20 consists of a base sheet 22 of any
suitable material, having a flexible vinyl, polyeth or other sheet or layer 26
coating its exterior surface and a second sheet 27 of similar flexible plastic
heat sealed to 26 to form a plurality of enclosures or pockets ~~ 28a and ~~ two
of which 28a and 28b are shown the exterior volumes 29a, 29b, etc of which are

means or may be briefly interrupted permitting inflation and deflation of a
plurality of said pockets. The following ideas have been conceived by the
construction of toys having shell bodies with walls molded of flexible vinyl or
polyethylene and filled with foamed, flexible plastic, the cells of which are
interconnected to a degree such that air will be expelled thru an opening in the
walls when squeezed by hand which air will slowly flow back into the interior
framed filler when the walls are released and which action may be used to create
a noise if a whistle or reed noisemaker is provided in said opening. This idea
was conceived last March an I intend to complete sketches and a description and
disclose them to Dave Rosenberg of Holiday Line,

P.V.F. spray Nov. 17, 1959 The following idea was conceived by me some time ago
for possible development. It is conceived to form a dispersion of polyvinyl
fluoride plastic having a characteristic such that it may be aerosoled (sprayed)
cold / dispensed from a can by means of pressure generated by Freon or the like,
or by means of conventional spray equipment. It is also conceived to form a
dispersion of P.V.F. and P.V.C. combined in the proportions necessary to impart
the desired characteristics to the resulting film or coating derived when
sprayed on a surface. I mentioned the above to Marvin Margolis today who I asked
not to mention it to any of the representatives of Taussig Paint Company until I
am ~~ n ~~ able to obtain sample ~~ from ~~ of P.V.F. from du Pont and
experiment with in an attempt to form a dispersion which may be sprayed. I asked
Harold Wilson about dispersions today and he mentioned use of colloid mill,
fluid energy mill and supersonic homogenizer Also conceived some time ago were
several methods of applying Teflon coatings to metal surfaces, viz. (1) First
clean surface, (2) then apply an adhesive layer or coating such as Eastman 910
adhesive, Pliobond or other strong adhesive which will tenaciously adhere to the
surface to be coated with the plastic (Teflon, etc), (3) Then apply the
Teflon/dispersion, preferably air-drying as produced by Acheson Colloids, (urea
plastic base) which does not require heat. If Eastman 910 is to be used, since
pressure starts polymerization this may be effected by mechanically compressing
the surface of the article (if sheet by applying a Teflon surfaced roller
thereto under pressure) or by means of pressure applied as one or a series of
shock waves impinged against the surface of the article or the article may be
vibrated itself with sufficient force to start polymerization of the adhesive.

which 21 is shown which when energized by a source of alternating current causes
the rod 14 and tip 15 to vibrate by means of magnetostriction. The end of 15
when brought into contact with a surface thru the opening 17 of 16 and and
vibrated thereagainst will effect, an abrading acted on said surface. A fluid
inlet line 19 and outlet line 20 are connected to openings in the wall of 12 and
fluid may be circulated thereby thru the interior 13 of the jacket or duct 12.
The rod 14 is preferably rearward or inward of the plane of opening 17 so that
if it is desired to get the tool or tip 15 into a cavity this may be effected
without interference from 17. However, 17 may be of various external end shapes,
the selection of which will result from a consideration of the type and shape of
the surface against which the tool is to be abutted. By making the end 12 and/or
16 transparent, the operator may visually note the condition of the surface
against which it abuts. Other features of the invention include in addition to a
simple and rapid adjustment of the longitudinal position of 15, a rapid (push
button) means for varying or stopping and starting the flow of liquid thru the
chamber. The end 200 of 20 is shown positioned near the ~~tip ~~ end of tool 15
so that liquid will circulate properly and material removed by 15 will be
immediately withdrawn. Also conceived, and reference is made to my copending
application for Ultrasonic Apparatus is the use of a pressure switch in the
chamber 13 which may operate to automatically stop the flow of liquid thru the
chamber in the event there is an interruption in the seal established between
the face of 17 and the work. J. Lemelson Nov. 18, 1959 Witnessed, Read &

Dec. 9, 1959 The following packaging ideas have been conceived which I intend to
apply for patents on: A plastic known as Formium, manufactured by Form Molded
Products Company is available and may be subjected to temperatures of about 500
degrees before it starts to discolor. I have conceived of the following
packaging ideas using bowls, dishes or otherwise shaped containers of Formium or
any plastic which may be used in an oven for cooking.

Fig.1 ash tray, step bowl, covered lid double bowl decorative pan (colored) baby
set, lazy susan In Fig,.1 (shown in cross-section) the package 10 consists of a
bowl shaped container 11 made of thin sheet, temperature resistant plastic
having a circumscribing side wall 12, a flat bottom 16 and circumscribing rim

flexible sheet or film ~~18 ~~ 18 of suitable plastic such as polyethylene
covers the container 11 and is preferably heat sealed to the upper surface of
the rim 14 in a circumscribing sealing band 5. The notation of F refers to a
food mixture which is shown partially filling the

### Page 28
container. The mixture F may be a cake or other food pre-mix which is in a
concentrated state and rises during the baking thereof when the container is
placed in an oven. In the embodiment of Fig 1, the mix F is preferably frozen
and in a solid condition not only for its preservation but also to prevent it
from flowing throughout the container during handling and forming a coating on
the walls thereof which may dry up or crust. It is noted that the volume 17
which is void of contents is required since the food rises upon heating and will
overflow the container unless supported by the side-walls. The notation 19
refers to Illustration, and/or instructions printed. STOP START NEW-PAGE In the
embodiment of Fig. 2, a container 21 made of thin sheet material, has a
circumscribing wall on walls 22 with a step formation 23 provided therein which

coated) by means of conventional beam deflection means which may be regulated by
means of an analog signal reproduced from magnetic tape or other means in
predetermined time relation to reproduction of other control signals; The
electron beam may also be focused along a predetermined axis for a predetermined
time with said material flowing there thru after the work is automatically
controlled in its movement and position by the automatic controller; The
material to be coated may be a semi-conductor conductor or insulator in any
desired pattern ~~ dicated by ~~ determined by movement of the beam and/or the
position of a mask of any shape or other means between the beam and work. A mask
held stationery or movable, having a plurality of openings any one of which the
beam may be directed thru by control of its deflection, is also conceived. The
beam may also be generated per se prior to introduction of the coating material
to condition (heat or erode) the surface of the work to be coated and/or
generated after wating to work to effect the material deposited on the work. By
first introducing one material into the beam and then a second without moving
the beam or work, alternate layers of material may be built up. By automatic
control of the focal point and/or the degree of divergences as well as power
input to the beam, the area to be coated (width of a line of coating for example
as beam is moved) may be controlled to effect the formation of such surface
patterns as line conductors, resistors, etc: A servo or servos may also be
provided and automatically controlled to select and/or position different areas
of a mask or different masks in alignment with a stationery or movable beam.

January 26, 1960 Applications and improvements in TPR (GE. thermoplastic
recording) It is conceived to adapt the recently released T.P.R system to single
frame recording for so called "animated cartooning" or the like. The system as
announced by G.E. involves only the production of motion pictures and since the
section of the thermoplastic tape heated by induction (in the G.E. apparatus) is
well in advance of the section or length of the tape, it is not possible to
shoot individual frames with a time delay between each which is ~~ faster ~~
longer than the time it takes for the frame to pass thru modification to the
apparatus. Accordingly, a number of modifications to apparatus of this type are
hereby proposed to effect "cartooning" or single frame function. (1.) In the
first apparatus, automatic control means are provided for automatically drawing
the single exposed frame~~ pa ~~ of tape pat the induction heating means to form
the so called "ripple" image in the thermoplastic and when so formed (after
the~~ same ~~single frame section has passed the heating device, the induction
heater is automatically turned off, followed by the automatic reversal of the
tape which is automatically driven rearward 1/28/60 1/31/60 LW EW 2/1/60 M

Time of heat (induction) "on" to determine usage until the length of the tape
following that length in which the image was last formed is in a position in
advance of the electron gun scanning field such that the next time the ~~ sca ~~
electron gun is energized (actually the next time the manually operated
switching control to effect the recording of a single frame, is energized). See
drawing hereafter. (2)In a second conceived apparatus, the tape is moved
intermittently, one frame at a time thru the field of the electron gun the beam
of which is modulated by the picture signal derived from scanning ~~ an ~~ image
field. The ~~ frame ~~ tape stops with the leading edge of the next frame length
in a position to be just scanned by the electron beam which is turned off at the
end of the frame sweep. While awaiting the (manual)switching action which will
initiate the next recording cycle in which the next frame length of tape will
receive an image charge pattern, one of the following actions may occur: (a)The
frame just scanned may have the corresponding (image) ripple pattern formed
therein (or any frame downstream thereof) by the automatic emerging of the
induction heating means. This may be effected by either a stationery induction
heater head or one which is automatically moved close to the tape adjacent the
scanning field immediately after or during scanning, energized or a
predetermined time, then deenergized an retracted. The frame following the frame
just scanned and heated may also be heated. To reduce this effect, an insulating
shutter or sheet member may be automatically moved over and made to engage
either or both surfaces of the thermoplastic tape to reduce or eliminates the
heating effect. The shutter gate may be a shielding material which will ~~ it ~~
reflect or absorb the induction energy. (b) The charge pattern may be retained
in the tape by means of a charge intensifier ~~put on~~

to retain it therein until it passes the induction head downstream of the
scanning field. When ~~ the ~~ each frame

### Page 61
enters the induction field, the induction heating means is energized "on" for
the period of time necessary to form the image therein. During the induction
heating cycle the length of tape behind (upstream of) the frame being heated is
either cooled by electronic, conduction ~~ or( ~~ contact with a cooled (liquid)
surface or convective means and/or is shielded by a member which absorbs or
reflects the ~~ induced ~~ radio wave energy. (c) Two or more tracks on tape are
employed with an automatic (flipflop) gating means for switching the output of
the means generating the picture signal to respective of the two electron guns.
This will permit sufficient time for the image on one tape to be formed, the
ripple pattern developed by heat and the tape recycled (or stopped per se) while
the surface of the other tape or channel is so operated on to form the next
image. The images from each may then be alternately scanned automatically and
reinserted or reformed, onto a single tape, or may be alternately projected by
means of an oscellating ~~ or rotating ~~ single mirror or prism or rotating
multi-faceted mirror, thru a single optical system onto a common screen or image
forming or scanning system. SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM OF THE APPARATUS #1 PAGE. 65.

FIG. 2 In the drawing (at the left,) all stationery components are assembled to
be supported by the walls of the housing 101 or bracket extending thereafter.
The apparatus 100 consists of a sealed enclosure 101 having a gear motor 102
mounted therein for driving a disc 104 which is a multilayer TPR. recording
material produced in accordance with the G. E. TPR tape with the exception that
the high melting base film is rigid enough to maintain the disc in a rigid
planer shape when rotated at recording speed by 102. An electron-gun 106
provides a raster scan or the like on an annular surface of 104 which provides
an annular charge pattern thereon. A first R.F. heater is positioned "down
stream" of 106 which melts the thermoplastic layer of 104 wherein the electro
static charges on the film and the ground plane depress the surface of the
melted layer creating the so called ripple pattern therein. The rippled surface
then ~~ is rotated ~~ passes thru an optical septum 110, 110' which may be used
for the projection of the image onto a screen or to an electronic scanning
device such as a cathode ray reading tube or the like. A second RF heater 112

pattern before it passes thru the exposure scanning field of 106. Several

received, for example, by the gun 106 in the form of modulated intensity and/or
deflection signals in a random manner such as from a library of said
information, the results of a computing mechanism or the output of a scanner
such as a video camera or radar device It may be desired to randomly record this
information as it is received and erase it only after it has been identified or
otherwise utilized. To prevent information to be recorded onto an area of 104
(or tape 26 of fig. 1) Which already has a recording thereon, the input to 106
may be from an image storage tube (or apparatus similar to Fig 2) which retains
the information until an area approaches the scanning zone adjacent 106 which is
free of an image ripple pattern. The notations 114 and 115 therefor relate to an
optical-relay positioned ahead of the scanning area of 106 which optically scans
thru the disc (or tape) across said annular recording area and provides a signal
output only when the light generated by a light source in 114 is diffracted by a
ripple or image deformation pattern. The signal (or lack of signal) may be used
to present the operation of the read beam of the intermediate storage tube
feeding 106, which read beam is triggered to cycle only upon the lack (or

area of 104 being scanned by ~~ 114 ~~ relay 114, 115 may be free of an image
(such as a white background of an image field), it is conceived to automatically
control the electron gun 106 to either provide a deformation in the form of an
annular ripple band near the outer rim of 104 (or the border of tape 26) when an
image charge pattern is being provided on a portion of the disc which ~~ def ~~
band deformation will deflect the light of relay 114, 115 the necessary degree
to either energize or deenergize said relay to cause a sequal output therefrom.
The scanner-relay 114, 115 may consist of a photocell and light source arranged
as follows:

preferably secured to a second housing 115a positioned the other side of disc
104 (or tape 26) by means of a rigid bar 114'. A lens 114d positioned in the

These design for a plastic sheet will ~~ form ~~ provide a material which is
flexible and may be used in packaging, yet which has reenforcing bands formed of
more rigid (irradiated) portions of the same material for added strength. Note
A- The plastic sheet may be irradiated as it is extruded, a calandered or while
otherwise in a molted state, by beams of radiant energy directed against the
moving sheet Note B- Irradiation may be effected by using a shield or mask to
prevent irradiation of areas not to be so changed Note C- Irradiation may be
used to change color, clarity or to provide unique designs in band or other
areas of sheet. The mask itself may provide ~~ the ~~ unusual contours in the
plastic sheet if it (a) moves with the sheet (radiator stationery), (b) sheet
and mask are stationery while radiation source irradiates (then turns off or is
shuttered off) Note D: If a mask such as lead is used which varies in thickness
across the mask, then if a constant intensity source of radiation is used the
areas of the sheet or article being irradiated which are in line with the
thinner portions of the mask will receive greater doses of radiation than those
areas in line with heavier portions of the mask. If color changes in the
material are experienced in proportion to the radiation, then shade may be
controlled by mask thickness (as well as radiation intensity and time of
exposure) and different shades of color or clarity may be effected in a design
in the irradiated material by using a mask having certain areas thicker than
others. A mask of tapering thickness will produce a gradual variation in color

July 14, 1960 It has been conceived by me to combine a means or plurality of
means for focusing sunlight with a semi-conductor means or other means for
converting heat into electricity to provide an efficient heat-to-electricity
energy converter. Reference is made to a plastic parabolic or spherical
reflector developed by me several months ago and recorded in another notebook
which may be used in one or more of the following configurations: Fig. 1

Fig. 1 illustrates the basic components of the invention which comprise an
assembly 10 consisting of a base 11 of sheet material having a cavity 12 of
parabolic or spherical shape and adapted for focusing sun-light in a
concentrated area near the focal plane of the focusing mirror defined

secured to the flange 11' of the base 11 and positions 16 at substantially the
focal plane of sunlight directed against the surface of the parabolic or
spherical reflection 12'. The area of 16 is preferably such that it will operate
efficiently even if the position of the ~~ fo ~~ center of the intense light
focused by 12' shifts ~~ whi~~ with changing attitudes relative to the direction
of the such. ~~ It is ~~ The converter 16 ~~ of~~ is furthermore large enough to
offer maximum electrical energy generation from portions thereof which are

card will replace punched cards and will have a much greater recording density.
The reading means (optical) of Fig. 3 p. 76 may be employed for readout and

Beam Deposition Continued/Nov 2-61 Fig. 3

All deposits are by beam controlled by analog signals reproduced from a recorder
which recorders programmed signals (reproductions) also control material
selection (introduced) into beam rate of flow thereof, travel of beam across
work modulation and on-off of beam, position of workpiece, handling of work
within and in and out of vacuum chambers, etc. Feedback signals for indicating
how much material is deposited and where to control beam position, rate of flow
and selection of different materials to be admitted to beam may be effected by
means of a reading electron beam directed by computer on programmed (recorded
signals) to scan selected area or scanning entire target as the material is
deposited or during periods when material is THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ &

derived by beam scanning may be analyzed by techniques as described in my
pending application "Automatic Inspection System" to ~~digitally ~~ determining
in digital form the characteristic (optical characteristic) of the material
deposited. Spectroscopy may also be employed in which a beam is directed against
the beam deposited area and causes an emission of electrons therefrom which is

positionally controlled by command signals derived from command recording as
described or comparator receiving command and feedback signal as described. II
Deflection control of beam (X,y. position plus intensity modulation plus
position of focus (Z control depending on position of the surface scandeposited
on) for (a) depositing semi-conductors metal or dielectric materials (b)
depositing plural materials simultaneously different beams (c) depositing plural
materials at different times by different beams (d) introducing different

control or refrence signals, plus work positioning, signals (optional), plus
focus adjustment signals (optional) plus other mentioned above are used to
simultaneously or sequentially control beams each depositing different material
or materials VI Beam Deposition Techniques (Miscellaneous features) (a) Electron
beam plus photographic techniques. (1) Beam deposits components onto conducting
film pattern formed by photo-etching, photocomposition (exposure to light and
developing) (2) Optical beam (laser light beam) is deflection controlled and
cooperates with deflection controlled electron beam in welding, machining,
effecting deposition, chemically reacting on ~~ dep ~~ material(s) deposited by
electron beam, etc laser light bean may also be used to carve photosensitive
film, expose it per se, develope image, used for corrective purposes (vaporize
or machine material (film) deposited by electron beam, vaporize material(s) to
be deposited or directed by electron beam, ~~ etc ~~ work, etc. Laser beam
deflection controlled by servo controlled mirror(s) controlled by reproduced
command signal or output of comparator or computer (b) Plural beams cooperate.
One vaporizes (laser or electron beam) material to be deposited; feeds it at or
to second deposition beam, ~~ there ~~ which is deflection controlled and
deposites material, third beam scans either second beam or surface which has
just received material to provide a feedback signal for a comparator (summary
amplifier or other) which provides an output to control both first and second
beams (i.e. on-off or intensity or focus of first beam and position of second
beam) (c) first and second beams are controlled by respective command signals

well by passing beam thru the mask respective comparator means each of which
receives some feedback signal generated by third beam scanning what is being or
was just deposited. (c) An apparatus for repairing, modifying or adding micro
miniature circuits has also been conceived based on beam scanning the circuit
already deposited (surface scanning) and determining by reading with the beam
the physical-optical or atomic structure of the circuit, by x-ray scanning, by
optical scanning said circuit (with a modulated light beam) or by a combination
of two or three of these scanning techniques, has been conceived. The output
signal derived by scanning is ~~ defined ~~ fed to a computer which thereafter
provides signals for controlling beam deflection, modulation, position of
workpiece, material deposition selection and feed to beam, mask selection, etc.
to effect a desired repair, change in structure, etc (d) Vaporization of
material in a primary electron beam(s) or by means of a mask through which
beam(s) the deposition beam is passed and picks up the material to be deposited,
carries it to work. (e) Material changed by new composition(s) formed in a beam
directed against a workpiece by either the action of the beams per se or the
coaction of the beam (temperature, etc)and two or more of the materials thereto
on one or more admitted material and any material of the workpiece. (f) Growth
of predetermined crystal structure by means of beam melting material(s) admitted
thereto and deposited, or by a combination of materials admitted to beam being
deposited thereby onto a crystal being grown. Programmed control of beams
deflection, on-off, modulation, focus; crystal movement; material flow into beam
(based on feedback derived by scanning beam, crystal, etc. (as described above)
fed into comparator also receiving command signal and providing difference
signal for control. (g) Creation of mask through which erosion electron beam is
directed for chemically &/or mechanically affecting (eroding, changing
chemically, welding, etc) the workpiece by means of photosensitive mask
material, thermoplastic recording film (T.P.R.) of General Electric Co which
mask is formed by exposure to a writing beam of said mask material which writing
beam is modulated to affect the desired image (transparent and opaque or ripple)
pattern in the mask. Mask ~~ may ~~ is in the field of the beam EL 12/4/61

directed against the workpiece (in the path of beam). (h) Use of a unique mask
in beam path made of a grating such as a diffraction grating produced by beam
etching thin plate for selective and controlled deposition of material
introduced  prior to or after passing thru mask. Plural diffraction gratings
placed at right angles to each other will produce line beams less than .001
inches in diameter. (i) Use of a mask to break up beam internal electron or
maser beam into a plurality of beams directed thereafter against selected areas
of the workpiece for ~~sele~~ effecting welding, machining (hole drilling),
erosion or deposition onto said select areas. (j) Program control (plus feedback
where necessary) of beam position (deflection), , etc position of workpiece, and
of different material fed into beam to selectively deposite different material
onto different areas of workpiece. (k) Exposure, machining, chemically changing,
development and firing of a photosensitive material to form a circuit by means
of a beam and use of a beam to deposit semi-conducting, dielectric & conducting
material onto selected areas of photosensitively developed circuits all by
automatic control as above. J Lemelson, December 1,1961 Dec. 1, 1961 New

Development work is continuing on the toothbrush and air conditioner, a more
rapid pace being prevented by the ~~ au ~~ inventor's research and school
activities. The following invention was conceived yesterday: A Chemically Heated
Shoe: The inventor conceives of a shoe for the human foot so manufactured that
the soles and (or) heels are made with hollow cavities or means thereof to carry
a liquid or ~~ chemical ~~ solid chemical which will produce the correct amount
of heat when reacting with another chemical for the purpose of warming the feet.
The following are some possible design considerations for this invention: 1 The
use of tubing or metal containers

### Page 8
October 26-49 for carrying the chemical while it reacts. (2) A one way valve for
filling the tubing or caveties with the chemicals. A valve for releasing the
reacted chemicals to all a new charge to flow in: (3) Use of a pressurized
container to hold the chemicals and release them when applied to the valve. This
would simplify carrying and filling of the caveties. The following sketch is a
preliminary design consideration.

The above may also be used as a pad which strap to the ordinary shoe or, the

light' and will look further into this patent in the development of this
invention. As stated, the glass tube winds around the interior of the shell.
Small holes, backed by colored celluloid (or uncovered) are drilled in the shell
opposite the glass tube. The liquid in the tube is opaque so that the bubble,
traveling past the hole has the effect of an opening shutter. Thus as each
bubble passes a hole, a 'blinking on' on the light from the inside of the shell
occurs. Preliminary Sketch of invention:

prevent spilling. This would be of great use in feeding babies. (2) A drinking
class holder of plastic or other material having magnets in its base to hold it

Nov 6, 1949 the usual placement ~~ of a cigarette ~~ is difficult such as in a
moving automobile where the vibration may jar it loose if just placed in the
ordinary holder. The clamping of the cigarette is accomplished by a light
magnetic force, not enough to squeeze the cigarette so that it is damaged. The
device is so made that the jaws which hold the cigarette do not completely close
when the cigarette is in place. A light magnetic force thus holds the cigarette
in position and removal is relatively easy. Exact design details will be worked
out. Magnetic gears on Magnetic Coupling: A coupling device consisting of two
wheels with teeth of magnetic material is conceived. The teeth do not mesh. One

idea for a Toy: The toy consists of two figures free to swivel about their bases
each of which is magnetic. Thus, rotation of one automatically rotates the other
by the repelling action of the magnets in the base. (i.e- all south poles point
out in one figure whereas all north poles point out in the other) Sketch of Toy:

Obstacle Course. or Pilot.

Nov. 20-49 21 Description of Game: Game consists of playing board of
non-magnetic material which is flat and smooth ~~ f ~~ enough for a small flat
bottomed object to roll or slide over. To this board are attached a number of
magnets, each of which represents an obstacle to the scoring puck or pellet. A
permanent magnet attached to a string, stick or other object or held in the hand
is used as the motivating medium for the puck. This is accomplished by moving it
over the puck which is also a magnet or of magnetic material and allowing the
force of the magnet to slide or roll the puck without lifting it to it. On
scoring, obstacles (magnets) nearest the starting point are scored lowest; when
and if the ultimate goal is reached without attraction to any of the obstacle
magnets, it is scored highest. Attraction to the motivating magnet automatically
eliminates the piece. Diagram of game board:

Nov. 21, 1949 Magnetic Game (continued) a variation of the game described on
page 21 would involve the use of a score board without obstacles but with just a
scored path painted on its surface over which the puck must be moved. Segaments
of the path are scored with increasingly higher numbers as the objective or
finishing point are approached. In testing out the magnetic game idea the
inventor noticed that it takes a considerable amount of skill to move the puck
without attracting it to the motivating magnet. The correct distance between the
pucks & motivator must be kept so that it is just lifted off the surface and may
be moved in the desired direction. Variations in game design: 1. The puck may be
shaped like an airplane which must overcome the obstacles along the course. 2.
Magnetic Football Game: The puck may be the ball carrier and the opposite side
composed of movable magnetics which are positioned before hand by the opposite
player. The controller of the puck must move it through the opposition. Jerome

Nov. 22, 1949 Conception of Invention: Magnetic Educational Toy: This toy
utilized sheet magnetic plastics. It consists of various flat shapes of magnetic
plastic sheet (squares, circular discs, half discs, dots, strips, etc) which
make up a kit. This come in various colors and are used to build figures by
letting them adhere to a metallic board to form the various design (over)

Nov.23,1949 An investigation has been made to "determine the availability of"
magnetic plastics for the above toy. It appears as if very little development
work has been done on magnetic plastics to date with the only available shapes
on the

market today being cylinders which are used for electronic work. Until such is
developed in sheet form for this toy, the inventor suggests the following
construction for the toy described on pp. 23,24 Backboard The assembly board on
which the shapes are mounted is made of sheet steel or iron or other magnetic
material (not a magnet) Assembly pieces: Piece #1, the head of the figure, is
made of a piece of sheet metal which is magnetic attractive. Set in the piece or
glued to it are small flat magnets for attraction to the backboard. The other
pieces 2,3,4,5,6,7,8, etc. are made of colored sheet plastic with small flat
magnets set in them for attachment to the backboard or glued to them. Typical

Nov. 26,1949 heated shoe), the inventor some time ago conceived of the following
method of shoe heating. The device ~~ of ~~ consists of a specially constructed
shoe which is insulated beneath the second sole, the second sole and heel made
with hollow cavities into which may be placed a cartridge or several cartridges
which, in turn, contain the reacting chemicals previously described. The
chemicals are separated from each other and may be caused to mix by bending the
cartridge or by some other mechanical manipulation such as the pressure of the
foot squeezing it. The inventor further recommends the uses of two chemicals
such as those used in the Thermite welding process, (iron oxide and aluminum)
which, as it is understood at this reading, is used in portable soldering irons
today to generate heat. Information on the  so called 'heat capsules' has been
requested from the manufacturer, a firm in Maryland. The inventor wishes to
bring out the following points on this invention. (1) The use of a highly
conductive witnessed by H. Lemelson Nov. 27, 1949 Nov. 26, 1949 material which
surrounds the capsule (heating capsule) cavity or heating tubes if a liquid
mixture of exothermic chemicals is added thru the valves (see p. 10) and which
extends to the far sections of the sole in contact with the foot of the wearer
for the conduction of heat to all the parts of the sole. (2) Design of the
Capsule: Due to the tremendous heat liberated when the Thermite process occurs,
it may be necessary to place the chemicals between two sheets of metal which are
placed close together; thus limiting the time of reaction. It is obvious to the
inventor that a method is needed for the regulation of the process such as a
valving system which allows only a small amount of the chemicals to react at a
time. (3)If exothermic liquids are used they may be introduced into a flat steel
walled cavity or tank which is embedded in the sole rather than the tubing
described. This would allow an easy replacement of the container if it is made
to slip out from the cavity in which it fits. Filling would be simplest thru one
way valves from a pressurized container. Jerome Lemelson Nov. 26-1949 Witnessed

controlling mechanism below the board consists of adjustable linkages,

slides and rotating arms so that magnets traveling below the surface can be
adjusted to travel a number of different shaped paths. The mechanism is motor
driven and easily accessible so that variations in the linkages may be made by
the operator when desired. Simple kimematies is thus taught to the youngster who
is mechanically minded. Adjustments in linkage arms, etc. may be easily made by
tightening and loosening small wing nuts or screws with a screw driver. The

1949 (8:30 PM) Conceptions of Inventions: The following inventions have been
conceived today. I: Doll; animated: The doll is made of rubber or plastic with a
relatively flexible neck (adams apple) and ~~ cheeel ~~ cheeks, the reson being
so that these arts may be made to move mechanically. For example, the adams
apple may be made to move up and

### Page 25
down as does a humans in swallowing by placing a round weight or ball in the
dolls mouth and having the doll swallow if thus activating a mechanism in the
neck which causes the adams apple to move ; or merely by placing the object on
the toung  of the doll or puppet. The same mechanism may also cause the lips to
curl up as in a smile or the eyes to open wide by linkages. Relatively flexible
rubber would be needed to imitate the facial and neck skin of the down. The
weight or ball would be recovered from the back of the doll. The same principle
could be applied to a small hard banks doll which smiles when a coin is
deposited in its mouth or thru  a slot in its head. Witnessed by: H. Lemelov

removable under which a loose wig (of grass etc) may be placed, there being hair
on the repacible. Thus a wig may be positioned by the child and trimmed with a
scissor. The child thus imitates a barber. (2) The same effect may be
accomplished by the use of a ceramic doll with a hollow head in which dirt is
placed and grass or chard is grown. The doll could be a window sill ornament for
the child to trim:every now and then. Witnessed by H. Lemelov 11/29/49 III
Hatching Chick Toy: This toy consists of an imitation egg shell (of plastic or
some other similar material) inside of which is a tiny chick. The egg is
assembled from two parts which realistically crack apart when a toy hen is
placed on it. This is accomplished as follows. The egg made ~~ to ~~ of two
separate partitions snaps together by a latch on the inside of the egg. A hole
through the shell to the latch is a recepticle ~~ to the latch ~~ for a peg in
the bottom of the hen. Thus when the peg is put in the hole and the peg is faced
down, the egg splits in two. The ~~latch ~~ egg may be spring loaded so that
once it is forced by the peg, there is a force alerted to open the shell.

shooting or throwing game in which objects are propelled toward the target. 1
The target ~~ bord ~~ board consists of objects such as little figures,
vehicles, airplanes, bottles etc. which serve as targets for the shooter to aim
at. These objects have little permanent magnets attached to them. The target
board itself has top, bottom and sides of steel sheet or other magnetically
affected material which serve as a base on which the figures are placed. A small
model plane, for example can be attached magnetically to a rod, or plug
extending from the ceiling and fired at. Small toy soldiers with magnets in
their bases can be attached to a mound in the target area and knocked off by the
sharpshooter. A small ball shaped object can be suspended magnetically and
knocked down. etc. Witnessed by: H. Lemelson 11/29/49 IV Magnetic Horseshoe Game

Nov. 28, 49 at the center of a verticle target and permanent magnetic horshoes
are pitched at the target, the object being to ring the peg. Rules are similar
to regular horseshoes. The magnets should be small and strong so that they do

cavities in the shoe each containing a reactive chemical. The chambers both have
a means for loading ~~ and ~~ new chemicals and removing the reacted chemicals.
The Chambers may be separated by a partition or valve to keep the chemicals out
of contact with each other after they have been loaded. A simple mechanism such

Witnessed by H. Lemelson 11/29/49 Nov.29, 1949 Conception of Several New Toy
Inventions: (I.) Magnetic Trapese Artists Toy: This invention utilizes the
phenomena of magnetic attraction and the fact that a magnet may be uncoupled
from a piece of iron or another magnet by a light force depending on the
strength of the magnet. The toy consists of a miniature replica of the circus
trapese artists. A small light toy figure of the performer is suspended from one
of the trapeses bars by a magnet in its base. The figure is cast outstretched ~~
and ~~ and ~~ if ~~ reaching out with its arms or, it may have movable legs and
arms for variation by the player. The hands of the figure are hook shaped so
that they may hook over the other bar or a bar suspended from another figure. (A
multitude of variations are possible. NOTE: An electromagnet on each bar, which
may be turned on and off, may be used rather than permanent magnets.) The toy
game or toy may be played in

Nov.29, 1949 several ways. Both the figure and the receiving trapese may be set
in motion by release from a high point on the usual ~~ as ~~ starting point of
circus performers by the use of a release latch or they may simply be put in
motion by the hand. Pressing a button may shut off the electromagnet ~~ at ~~ on
the bar of the toy performer and release him to the other bar or his hooking to
the other bar may separate his permanent magnetic base from the original bar.
Two performers may also be used using magnets of different strength so that one
may be uncoupled while the other holds fast. The hooking action may be attained
by an outstretched bar attached to the hands of one performer. Again, the
release of one figure may be accomplished by an electromagnet shutting off on
the bar to which he is attracted or by hooking to the other bar. Sketch:

Note: In respect to the trapese toy, coupling of the two figure may be
accomplished magnetically- utilizing either stronger magnets in the hands of the
artists for coupling than the base magnet of one or an electro-magnet release
from one and attraction from the others outstretched arms. Witnessed by H.
Lemelson 11/29/49 II. Propelled Toy Ducks: or Whate (WHALE). This invention
consists of a toy duck OR WHALE of light ~~ colored ~~ material such as plastic;
wood, rubber etc a light metal which floats stabely and is propelled thru the
water in one of the following manners. I. Mechanical Propulsion: This may be
attained thru a paddle coupled to a winding spring or a paddle wheel also spring
wound, on by a propeller coupled to a winding spring. II. Jet Propulsion: This
may be accomplished in one of several ways. (a) By steam pressure utilizing a
standard put-put system in which a small candle or tablet is burned under a
small tank of water. A pressure is thus built up against the back pressure of
the water, the steam being emitted at rapid intervals causing a net forward
thrust - (known to the art) (b) By the inflation of a plastic bag

Nov. 29, 1949 or baloon within the toy figure and the resulting escape of the
gases rearward A simple baloon may be used which inflates within the figure to
its approximate shape or the following system may be employed The inside baloon
~~ figure ~~ may be blown up at some point on figure's surface such as the bill
of the duck, the spout point of the whale, etc. A one way valve consisting of a
tiny ball and seat at the filling joint may be utilized to prevent escape from
this point. During filling, the escape nozzle may be shut off by a twisting
action or by a plug. This too may have a one way (escape) action to prevent
water from filling the figures bladder: A small spring loaded ball would suffice
for this purpose. The same principle may be applies to the other shapes of the
toys. Jerome Lemelson Witnessed by: H Lemelson 11/29/49 (Refer to pp. 11-13) The
inventor conceives that it may be necessary to use a heating element to generate
large enough bubbles for the blinking ornament to function properly.

Nov. 30, 1949 Conception of Inventions: I. Toy Cow Which Can Be Milked: This toy
consists of the figure of a cow which is molded, stamped, or otherwise formed of
a light material and which has the following mechanism so that the cow may be
milked. The cow’s head may be manufactured so that it is bending over, or may be
made to bend over a pan containing milk, water, or other liquid which resembles
milk. A tube in the cow’s mouth submerges in the liquid with the mouth. The cow
drinks up the liquid when to operator pumps the tail or pulls it, thus either
operating a pump in the body of the cow or drawing in on a piston and filling in
the manner that a syringe is filled. The piston is spring loaded so that the
liquid is under pressure. A one way valve at the mouth prevents the liquid from
flowing out the mouth. A valve at the cow’s ~~ brest ~~ breast is made so that
it will allow passage of the fluid only when the breast is pulled as in milking
the real cow. The cow can be made to “moo” when it’s milked for realism. A
preliminary sketch will be drawn when the inventor finds time in a few days.

November 30, 1949 Spouting Wale (Propelled) This toy consists of a floating
replica of a wall of light material inside of which is a mechanism for loading
(filling a reservoir with water") similar to that in the cow. Intake is through
an opening or hole in the bottom of the whale (a one way valve consisting
possibly of a spring-loaded ball and seat preventing outflow thru the intake. A
string, lever (pull type) or pumping tail or fin loads the water reservoir which

Record of Conception of New Inventions The following inventions were conceived
on this date all involving the spring

### Page 35
Dec. 1-49 loaded piston described in the inventions on the preceding two pages.
The spring loaded piston is used as a source of energy to supply a stream of
water for an optical effect or may be used to propell a device (toy) thru the
water. The following sketch will describe it for a preliminary design
considerations. (large intake valve opening for easy loading) 1) is a pull rod
for loading or cocking the piston. It is pulled back by the operator in loading:
(2) is a spring which is compressed when the piston is cocked. (3) is the
cylinder or shell in which the piston slides,(4), the piston, (5) the reservoir
for the liquid, (6) may be a one way intake valve and (7) a one way exhaust
valve which may be shut on or off for loading by a screw, needle valve, etc. The
device is being developed by the inventor. Jet Propelled Boat: This toy consists
of a toy boat made of a light or hollow material inside of which is placed the
above spring loaded piston. The piston is cocked directly by hand

Dec. 1,1949 possibly by the use of a lever to gain a mechanical advantage. To
minimize leaks, it should be made of a relatively flexible or soft material
which expands when wet against the walls of the cylinder. It should be backed
with a stiff material - Rubber may serve the purpose of the flexible material

II JET VALVE CONTROL InTake & valve Piston STRong Spring. loading Arm. (or a
string may be attached to the piston rod here and pulled) Cocking the piston
loads the reservoir. When released, the spring forces the piston rearward and
since water is an incompressible liquid, the pressure of the spring forces it
out of the exhaust orifice at a high velocity which jet propells the boat. III
Fire Boat: Note: an additional tap off hose or line may be run from the cylinder
to supply water for a fire hose treated on the deck of the boat. IV Paint
Sprayer: The spring loaded piston and cylinder may also be utilized for spraying
small quantities at a time of thin paint. This could be utilized for a cheap
sprayer for such items a touch up

insecticide, etc. to be expanded. V Toy Game: This game consists of a statically
mounted on moving toy figure which is composed of parts which ~~are~~
magnetically hold each other together. The object of the game is to knock the
figure apart with pellets from a spring loaded gun. For example, the figure may
be that of a snowman of white plastic. The pellets may be shaped & colored like
snowballs. The idea or purpose would be to attempt of break-up the snowman by
first hitting this to magnetically held on hat, then his head then his limbs,
etc. To be expanded. VI. Toy Automobile which can be stopped at red light. This
toy consists of a small wind up or battery powered automobile which turns around
on a smooth ~~back~~ forward on a table. A traffic light at one point of the
roadbed or track can be operated on or off, red or green. When the red is
operated, an electric magnet beneath the roadbed is turned on, and this in turn
causes Dec. 1, 1949 the toy to stop by either attracting a light spring loaded
switch in the car cutting off its powder (under the body of the car) or just
holding the car to the board. The car would have to have its body's bottom
nearly sliding on the surface for this latter technique to succeed. The author
has just conceived of further applications of this principle. The
electro-magnets placed at various points under the roadbed may be made to cause
the toy to go thru various gyrations, and to control its motion by holding
itself and necessarily the car perhaps say 90 degrees to its original direction
~~with~~ by using another electro magnet for rotation. A small alnico permanent
magnet in the car may help the action. Further investigation and development is
necessary. Jerome Lemelson Dec. 1, 1949 Witnessed by H. Lemelson Dec. 5, 1949
December 2, 1949 It is conceived that the precociously described piston (p.50)
may prove quite costly to manufacture for a toy. The following alternatives are
conceived if the cost is too high. If a piston is used

### Page 37
it would probably be ~~ most ~~ preferable to make it of leather or rubber with
a stiff metalic or other backing such as the piston in the master cylinder of an
automobile's hydraulic brake. Alternatives to the piston described. (1) Use of a
spring loaded bellows similar to that used in a pressure measuring instrument.
This would again involve a cylinder in which the bellows is placed, a large one
way intake valve for loading and a smaller controllable exhaust valve for the
various applications (2) Use of a flexible bag which may be filled with the
liquid merely pouring in there a neck in the container  sure Before loading, a
piston loaded by a spring is cocked so that it may react later on the bag (i.e.
baloon , plastic bag, etc) Sketch:

The bag (3) is filled thru (1), a fitting with a screw on cap. (4) is a piston
riding in container (2). It is spring loaded by spring (5) when cocked. (6) is
the plunger for cocking the piston. The device may be supplied with a stop
mechanism

(7) which holds the plunger in an 'out' position in loading. Reference is made
to the mechanism in the fountain tooth brush on page 8. The inventor has
conceived of using this mechanism to feed shoe polish in a pasty form or in a
liquid for thru the handle of a shoe brush where it is stored for the purpose of
supplying the polish merely by pushing the button in the handle which decorates
the mechanism. A sketch will clarify:

designed by the inventor and the drawings are being reproduced. Conception of a
Toy: (Dentist's Kit) This toy (described in brief) is a make-believe dentist kit
which consists of a dummy or doll with a large mouth which

### Page 38
Dec 2, 1949 can be opened and a removable set of teeth which can be worked on by
the child playing with the kit. A foot powered drill is supplied together with
teeth which may be drilled. The teeth are made of a soft material which ~~ ia ~~
is easily drilled. A silvered putty or clay is used for fillings and brass sheet
is supplied for gold cap mutation. The dummy may also be set in a swivel chair
for realism. Other dental accessories may also be supplied such as a toy x-ray
set with a light or camera in it, etc. II Doctor Set (Surgical) This involves
supplying a plastic doll or dummy in ~~ with the  in kit form together with
simple instruments for performing an operation. The doll may be so made that it
comes apart for operating purposes and panels open up over its chest, intestine,
etc. The internal parts may then be made of a soft plastic putty like material
which is easily cut, stitched, etc. Witnessed by H. Lemelson Dec. 3, 1949 Dec.
5, 1949 Doll With a Heart Beat This invention involves the placing of a single
spring wound mechanism with an endurance of several minutes or more inside

the doll or puppet. The noise of the heart beat may be attained in one of
several ~~ a number of ways namely: (1) By having a light arm, attached to the
mechanism, strike a hollow drum or sounding board at a pace similar to normal
heartbeat. (2) By the use of a watch or clock mechanism of correct dimensions
and material to produce a beat which is somewhat like a heartbeat. (3) By the
use of a small electric motor coupled to the correct mechanism for the
production of a beat. (4) By the use of an electro-vibrator of a slow frequency
(80 to 100 per second) which flexes a membrane or drum. Others will be recorded
as conceived. Manicuring Doll: This invention refers to a toy figure or doll
which can be manicured by the playing child. This is accomplished by the use of
plastic finger nails which are removable and replaceable merely by snapping them
into the finger roots. They are held in place by compression of the plastic
finger nail as it is bent for inserted into The toy is unique in that the nails

This invention involves a doll with a movable jaw which has teeth which may be
removed, either as a false tooth bridge or singly. Two other dolls which will be
described tomorrow are (1) a whistling doll (2) a doll which plays the
harmonica. Dec. 4, 1949 Doll with Toy Whistle: This doll consists of a
conventional toy doll which is equipped with facilities for blowing a toy
whistle. Sketch.

Doll head. Tapered hole (1) (2) tubing to (3)

Tube to fit in hole in doll's mouth WHISTEL

Dec. 4, 1949 A conventional doll's head is so made that a small hole (1) is
formed in the middle of its lips which connects to tubing (3). The hole may be
so tapered that insertion of the tube to the end of a conventional or especially
made whistle for the doll may fit in and be held securely by a little pressure.
A tapered hole for example would suffice. The tubing (3) may either extend out
the back of the doll so that the whistle may be blown by a human; may extend to
a bellows in the doll so that squeezing will blow the whistle or may extend to a
bellows outside the doll which may be squeezed. Drinking Doll: This refers to a
doll which drinks water or other liquid thru a straw. The straw again fits in a
small tapered hole in the doll's lips. The liquid is conducted thru a tube in
the body of the doll to a diaper exit as in the well known diaper Dy-Dee doll.
Suction may be attained in one of the several ways. The well known suction pump
which connects to a water supply (running) may be employed (utilizing the
Bernoulli principle of pressure drop at the down stream end.).

### Page 40
The syphon phenomenon may be employed

### Page 41
Dec. 4, 1949 with the source of liquid higher than the exit or down stream end
of the interval tubing in the doll. A flexible tubing straw would probably be
needed to simplify the syphon action. A small pump operated by a spring wound
motor may also be employed. A spring loaded suction piston or diaphram may be
employed (see pp. 50, 54). The piston would be so arranged that the liquid would
be drawn by the piston ~~ rather th ~~ into the cylinder rather than forced out.
Drinking Doll (Simulated) This doll ~~ is so ~~and the associated mechanism is
so made that it appears to be drinking a liquid. The following sketch will
clarify. Sketch:

The invention operates as follows. A standard doll (1) sits facing a bowl, cup,
etc.

Dec. 4, 1949 (2) signifies a small hole in the lips into which fits (3) a glass
tube which is the tube of the bubble-light described on page 15 (re- Carl W .
Otis patents) The bubble light extends into a glass (5) and, if necessary, into
the base (8) to conceal its generating mechanism (6) and (7). This is not shown
positioned in the base (8) in the sketch. If it is placed in the base (8), the
drinking glass or bottle (5) may be of a clear or opaque material. (9)
represents a wall plug to activate the mechanism and generate large bubbles
which give the effect of drinking. Batteries could possibly be employed to heat
an element which would generate the bubbles; the bubbles could be generated by
chemical action in the liquid or by chemical action to heat the liquid (rep re:
pp. 42-43) Omit A fourth method to generate bubbles would be to fill a reservoir
within the doll with water using a closed vessle and by a syphoning action,
allow it to flow thru the straw and into the container. Thus as each drop flows
out the end of the straw tubing, an air bubble must flow back up the tubing to
replace the volume of fluid in the storage tanks witnessed by - H. Lemelson

Bubble Light described on pp.11-13, the inventor plans to reveal the invention
to Mr. Henry Sadacca of Noma Electric Company, N.Y. for the purpose of
determining if the aforementioned would be interested in entering into an
agreement with the inventor for the further development and manufacture of the
device: In respect to this invention, the inventor wishes to record a variation
in the application of the principle. Referring to the below diagram, the
inventor suggests the placement of lucite rods (1) extending from the holes (2)
in the shell (3) to a short distance out so that immitation branches may be
placed on the tree. The lucite rods will then appear to be small blinking bulbs.
The rods may be colored a variety of colors for a Christmas tree light and bulb
effect and they may be painted opaque up to their ends

Noma Electric is quite interested in the invention, a decision being held up
pending a full reduction to practice (constructive reduction to practice) of a

Marshall also revealed that the company had experienced difficulty in causing
their bubbles (smaller than these) to flow around corners such as in the
spiraling tube and up a tube which is inclined more than 30 with the horizontal.
The inventor (myself) then suggested the following construction of the ornament,
a sketch having been made beforehand. The new idea consists of merely using
sever tubes which bubble in the tree shell each tube covering a verticle or low
spiraling (below 30) line of holes. Sketch:

Dec. 5, 1949 Variations of the Bubble Light(opaque) Applications:

I. Opaque bubble light placed in front of slot in shell. This application
   produces the effect so that the bubbles themselves will be seen to rise while
   the rest of the opaque liquid keeps out the light behind or inside of the
   ornamental shell. The following sketch will help to clarify:

Viewer I Viewer

The observer at (1) looks at slot (6) in container (3) inside of which are
mounted my opaque bubble lights each effectively covering a slot such as (6).
The opaque liquid in the bubble light (2) is thus viewed thru the slot. A light
bulb (5) supplies the light which penetrate thru the bubbles as they ascend. The
inventor wishes to make it clear

### Page 45
Dec.5.49 that there are numerous variations in the application of this principle
One application involves placing the bubble lamps ~~ in ~~ behind slots in a
shell which is placed in a glass to represent the liquid efforvesing or bubbling
such as in a glass of CocaCola, etc. Of the outer display glass is translucent
and colored a dark brown or other color, the effect of the traveling bubbles in
the opaque liquid and permitting light to pass thru them as they ascend is like
the bubbling in a glass of cola or other carbonated drink. The invention can
thus be applied to any toy or small display advertizing unit which requires a
cheap method of blinking tiny lights on and off or a rising light bounce for
optical effect such as bubbles in a liquid, etc. A miniature toy such as the
movie house with twinkling or blinking lights described on page 14 will now be
expanded a bit upon. The sketch on page 67., (1) represents a toy frame of a
theater made of plastic; wood, metal sheet or other light material (2)
represents its sign which is made to resemble the blinking sign of the average

movie theater by application of the opaque bubble light and hole or slot effect.
The effect of a row of light blinking on and off may be attained by placing a
series of small holes in a row at close intervals to each other. The holes (3)
in the sign (2) are shown. A plug 6, is attached to an extention coard (5) which
in turn receives the bubble light plug (7) (4). Sketch.

Witnessed: H Lemelson 12/7/49 Dec. 6, 1969 Conception of Utilization of The
Bubble Effect

The author learned today from a member of the Kenttee Company, a firm which
manufactures glass ornaments that the bubble effect may be obtained in a tube by
the heat from the body and hand. Construction is as follows:

Glass tube Liquid with ~~ low boiling ~~ high vapor pressure probably CC14 with
some Bromine Added. also ~~ high ~~ low boiling temperature (JHL Dec. 9, 1949)
Heat of hand warms vapor in expansion chamber Chamber restriction

69 Dec. 6, 1949 Utilization of the Tube with the Following Device:

(1) Top to Glass (2) Expansion Chamber (3) Colored Opaque or Translucent or
transparent liquid to simulate milk, soft drinks, etc (4) Bubble Tube (5)
Restriction Glass Drinking Mug

The expansion chamber (5) is located in the handle of the mug so that when ~~
some ~~ user picks up mug, bubbles in tube (4) which simulate a straw rise. The
tube(4) ~~ sub ~~ is supported by either a false top(1) as shown or a false
liquid surface in the glass of glass or plastic. Jarome Lemelson Dec. 6 1949 The
same principle can be applied to a glass of milk with simulated bubbles The
chamber would be in contact with the side and the base of glass so that holding
in hand will cause bubble to be generated.

A standard heat type bubble tube which will react to the warmth of the human
body. An experiment consisting of a bubble tube (1), an expansion chamber (2), a
restricted or necked down section (3) and the low vapor pressure liquid (6) is
sewn into the top of a boys cap or hat (5). (4) Signifies material used to hold
the chamber (2) and tube in place. An experiment by the inventor has shown that
the heat given off from the human head thru the hair and also thru a piece of
cloth is sufficient to start and

Dec. 7, 1949 maintain the bubble effect. Thus the wearer of the cap has a device
which continually bubbles while he is wearing it. The device w ~~ device and cap
will be further developed. Jerome Lemelson Dec. 7, 1949 Witnessed by: H.

Dec.10-1949 Five hours were devoted last nite in an attempt to construct a
bubble tube of the type mentioned on page 68. Though the tube is already known
to operate successfully, the author wishes to make one for experimentation with
devices such as those mentioned on pp. 11, 12, 63, 64. (i.e. with a black opaque
dye dissolved in the liquid). Although a vacuum pump was employed, it was
impossible to evacuate enough air for body heat to generate bubbles. The
experiments will continue utilizing liquid nitrogen to first freeze the liquid
in the tube before applying the vacuum pump and sealing the glass tube.
Construction of a device similar to that sketched on p. 65 and 67 to illustrate
the feasibility of using bubbles in an opaque liquid to give a blinking light
effect when the tube containing the liquid (~~bubbling with  generating large
enough bubbles) is placed before a series of holes or a slot has been completed.
Operation of the unit proves that the desired effect is obtained. Jerome
Lemelson Witnessed: Howard Lemelson Dec. 10-49 Dec. 14, 1949 December 14, 1949
Two hours were devoted this evening to the reduction (constructive) to practice
of the bubble blinking ornament described on pp. 11, 12. Attempts to vacuum seal
the liquid

in a tube by freezing in liquid nitrogen failed due to poor connection to the
vacuum pump and boiling or evaporation of the frozen liquid when the torch was
applied. To be continued Conception of Inventions: The following December 16,
1949 The following inventions were conceived by the author about a week ago and
are now being entered for the first time. Doll With Heartbeat: This inventions
consists of a mechanical means for simulating heartbeat in a doll such as a wind
up mechanism which releases ~~ and an escapement operating at heart beat
interval (about 72 per minute) which released an arm to strike against a small
drum. the inventor intends to put the wind-up mechanism in the leg or arm of the
doll so that when either of these limbs are pumped about the knee or elbow
joints, the mechanism will automatically wind up the doll. The mechanism will be
made with a tension release so that it is impossible for the child to over wind
the toy and break the spring or mechanism.

its stay, a trigger is tripped which sets in motion the wind up mechanism
winding up the string into the hand. The cycle is repeated when the ~~ top of
the ~~ yoo-yo reaches the top of its travel. (2) By a button places in the rear
of the dolls' back which, when pressed by the child, releases the yo-yo and at
the same time winds up a spring sufficiently to return the yo-yo to its up
position. Witnessed: 12/29/49 Howard Sketches:

operation is wound in similar ways to those discussed on Dec 16, 1949 pp 74-75
Magnetic Skii Jumper: This toy consists of a toy figure of a skiier of a light
material which is made to slide down a skii run and which is effected by an
electromagnet which repells or attracts the device which also has magnets in its
own base. By varying the amount of current through the electro magnets its
strength may be varied and hence controls the range of the jumper by repelling
him just before he leaves the ski jump. This may be illustrated as follows:

December 19, 1949 Improvements and Variations on Invention on page 11, 12, 64,
65. The author has conceived of new applications of the opaque bubble light and
the effect produced - which involves some material changes and design
alterations in the original invention. The new application consists of
combining the opaque bubble tube with neon, argon, fluorescent or other such
light emitting gas filled tubing in such a way that an effect is produced
wherebye  the bubbles, traveling along the tube, appear as a series of moving
lights by having a continual lighted back piece (the fluorescent or neon tube).
Construction could be as follows: depicts "FRONT" and "Side View" each labelled
respectively. The "Side View" has the following corresponding labels written
with arrows gesturing to each respective piece; -2 -Fluorescent or Neon Tube (1)
-Bubbles -4 Figure 2  depicts a similar drawing with the following corresponding
labels written with arrows gesturing to each respective piece; -2 -Flurescent
light (1) -3 -4 depicts a third drawing on the second page, beside the next
paragraph. It is labelled with numbers 1-4. Figure 1 shows a simple construction
of the device involving two tubes, (1) a fluorescent (neon) tube backs the
standard bubble tube (2) described on pp  11, 12 as containing an opaque liquid
3. The fluorescent tube may be covered with a black paint or other opaque
material on its sides and back so the only light visible to an observer is that
shining through the bubbles (3). For advertising purposes where this device may
be used to make signs 'dynamic', a heating element may be used to generate
bubbles and drive them through the solution. Jerome Lemelson Dec. 19, 49

effect and bubble tubes in general) Perfected a bubble tube (operating) with an

Jan 2, 1950 On Saturday Dec. 31 purchased 1.85 worth of plastics for experiments
with bubble tubes on p.p. 68 - 71. Also purchased black dyes for inventions on
pp. 62 - 68. (Blinking effect) J Lemelson  Dec  Jan 2 '50

January 2, 1950 Nine hours of experimentation today with the bubble tube
described on pp - 12, 60 - 69, 70 and 71 involved the use of a vacuum pump, a,
Tconnection with shut off valves, CC14, and necessary glass tubing and working
tools. Several tubes containing CC14 as the bubbling liquid were made to operate
successfully by heat from the hand. It was discovered that the beck down section
in the bubble tube (restriction, re: pp. 68-72) can connect to a section which
is in line with the bubble tube provided that the restriction is the right
diameter. Diagram : B - Tube; Bubbles in Liquid; A - Restriction; C Chamber.
This operates quite satisfactory, particularly if the heat is applied to A. The
bubbles are large and numerous if the Chamber C is just brought in contact with
an electric bulb or placed above the bulb. The heat of the hand will also work
quite well. With this knowledge, the inventor has conceived of the following
construction for a bubble cap device first described on pp. 70 and 71 Referring
to the sketch on the next page; (1) is the bubble tube with liquid

made removable and may be replaced if broken. JHL Jan 2 - 1950 Witnessed:
H-Lemelson 5, Jan 3, 1950 Since a black (opaque) liquid in the heavier (larger
diameter) tube may prevent the transmittal of light due to the liquid flowing
down the side of the tube, the following tubing construction is conceived as a
poseable solution to the problem. Crosssectional views of :

The shaded areas (1),(2) and (3) refer to small channels in the tubing thru
which the opaque liquid may flow as the buble rises thus permitting the entire
area (x) to be clear to allow light to pass thru tube. Of the tube is titled a
off horizontal, the device will work even better. Titling ordinary round tubing
(with opaque liquid bubbling) alows a clear bubble to flow with the liquid
passing down the side tilted. Jerome Lemelson Jan . 3 - 1950 Witnessed Jan 5,

May not have fully explained it to him. With respected to the heated shoe (first
mentioned on p. 10 of this book), the inventor has conceived of the following
design modifications Chemically Heated Shoe: 1. The use of a cartridge
containing ingredients which will react in a similar manner to those in the
"thermal" process. This would be placed in a cavity in the shoe and caused to
react when needed by a spring mechanism (Note- similar to the capsule now used
to heat soldering iron) In order for this to work properly (r.e.- conduction of
heat to all parts of the sole and bottom of the foot, the following construction
would be a possible solution. See figure on next page. The cartridge, a long
flat container, is placed in the cavity in the sole through opening(1). It is
then started to react and heat is conducted through (2) to the inner part of
shoe. An insulating Witnessed by: H. Lemelson Jan 30, 1950

March 13, 1950 Conception of Invention: Title: Compact Plastic Processing Unit
Uses: For filling life rafts and the like with spongy plastic to make it non
sinkable and puncture proof. also for use camping equipment such a tent and hut
flooring, insulation etc This invention is conceived with light spongy plastics
such as Lockfoam (Lockheed Aircraft), stearofoam, etc which are used for
insulation; etc. and particularly those which ~~ are processed ~~ require heat
for processing. The author has conceived of a method and device for making this
plastic in an emergency or Witnessed by Howard Lemelson April 16, 1950

### Page 63
March 13, 1950 when needed for use in the field. Plastics such as Lockfoam, for
example, are first mixed and available in liquid form. When heated (exact
temperatures vary with plastic) they expand to as much as 25 or more times their
original volume and are composed of a cellular structure in which air is trapped
thus making a fine insulating material or filler for life preservers, life
boats, etc. The following sketch is a preliminary design of a compact unit for
the production of this plastic in its expanded form so that it may be made
easily outside of the laboratory or factory with a minimum of effort.

For a description of the unit I refer to the above sketch. The unit is housed in
Witnessed by H. Lemelson April 16, 1950

March 13, 1950 a container (1) which is shown in crossection. The container
contains an inner container (2). Which is surrounded by a chemical or chemicals
(3) for the production of an exotheric reaction. If thermite or similar
chemicals are used, an igniter (5) may be utilized to start the exothermic
reactions to produce heat. If two reacting chemicals are utilized they may be
kept apart be partitions or separate containers. In this latter case, their
bringlong together by breaking the partition or one of the containers may be
accomplished by a hammer tap or other means which may be manually done or
automatically through a mechanism. Once heat is generated around container (2),
stopper may either melt or be forced out by the pressure within (2) as the
plastic expands, thus filling whatever space is desired. One or more of these
units may be placed in a deflated life raft for example. When it is desired to
inflate the raft (in an emergency for example) a C02 cartridge may be triggered,
the same action triggering this unit for the production of the plastic which
fills the raft thus making it punctureproof (over) Witnessed by Howard Lemelson
April 16, 1950

### Page 64
March 13, 1950 Another use may be in a compact artic tent where insulation is
needed for the flooring. In this case, the unit would be placed in a deflated
bag for use when needed. The unit may also be used for wall insulation in homes,
etc, for toys wherein it fills a baloon to make a permanent toy baloon shape. To
be further investigated Jerome Lemelson March 13, 1950 April 16, 1950 Note: The
interval between Mar. 13 and Apr. 16 during which time no entries were made in
this book was due to (1) the inventor studying for examinations, (2) magazine
article committments and (3) a 10 day vacation. The following devices were
conceived during the aforementioned interval and are recorded now for the first
time. #1 Tire Handling Device: This device is intended to be used to simplify
the changing of tires by the car operator when a flat tire occurs on the road.
It provides (a) a means for handling the spare and blown out tire with minimum
effort and lessened Witnessed by: H. Lemelson April 16, 1950

chance or dirtying hands and clothing and (2) a means for positioning the tire
prior to placing it on the wheel hub. A sketch will suffice:

The device consists of a frame of steel tubing which fits around the auto wheel,
said wheel resting on spindle (1) which goes thru center hole in tire hub. The
frame consists of bars (5) and (4) which are joined at 6 so that they may freely
rotate with respect to each other (2) is a pivoting support bar which supports
(4) thus holding the tire off the ground while it is being prepositioned before
the ~~ wheel ~~ axle hub. Lateral tipping is prevented by a bend (7) in (5)
which rests on the ground. The tire may be pulled up off the ground by handle
(8). A screw in 5 at the bend (7) threads into bolt (3) end when Witnessed by:
Howard Lemelson April 16, 1950

### Page 65
April 16 1950 it is desired to more the tire over the ground by use of the
frame. #2. Automatic Car Jack: This device is a small portable car jack of the
type utilized to change tires and utilizes the pressure stored in a small
cartridge (such as a CO2 cartridge) to do work on a piston and hence raise the
jack and the car. This would require (1) a cartridge contain gas at sufficient
pressure to do the required amount of work (2) A piston (sealed) on which the
gas (expanding) can work (3) a valve for regulating the flow of gas into the
cylinder containing the piston (4) Possibly a means for creating the proper
mechanical advantage necessary (possibly two pistons) (5) a means for releasing
said pressure after the job is done so as to lower the bumper slowly, (6) a
means for allowing the gas in the cartridge to escape and flow thru the system
so as to do work on the piston (7) a safety one way regulator in the event of a
leak in the system. To be continued #3 Device (Machine) for Manufacturing bubble
tubes: The inventor has conceived of a new technique for mass producing bubble
tubes, Witnessed by: Howard Lemelson April 16, 1950

April 16, 1950 particularly in the manufacture of tubes of plastic material.
However, the method may also be utilized for glass tube manufacture. The
following is a simple sketch of the basic elements involved:

(1) Refers to the walls of the container or tube which is filled with the liquid
(2) of high vapor pressure low boiling temp. An injection nozzle (3) has a ring
(4) or neopreen or other flexible material which is not affected by the liquid
(2), (4) fitting snugly in a groove in (3) as shown and having an outer diameter
greater than the inner diameter (9) of the tube or container. A hole (6) is
drilled near the perimeter of the tube (6) which exits at (7) and is used to
allow trapped air and liquid to escape from (1) This hole is closed off at (7)
at the proper instant by a stop such as the slide valve arrangement (5) shown.
Action is as follows. Liquid (2) is placed in said tube or container (1) so that
is nearly filled. witnessed by H. Lemelson April 16, 1950

April 16-1950 (3) is then inserted on ring(4) is compressed so as to make a
tight seal in (1). The Tube(3) is then pushed forward until liquid begins to
flow thru(6). This hole (6) is then stopped up at(7) by slide valve(5). The
tube(3) is then drawn out a short distance so that a partial vacuum space
appears somewhere in (1). A liquid material is next injected thru hole(8) and it
solidifies, sealing off(1) from the atmosphere(3) is withdrawn after (10)
solidified sufficiently. Jerome Lemelson April 16-1950 Witnessed by: Howard

Conception of Invention: Automobile Washing devices. (over)

The following devices for washing automobiles and the like have been conceived
by the author. (1) Automatic car washer: This consists of a device which is
attached to the automobile (i.e. for example under the running brand) continued
on Mar. 22-1950 (delay due to business committments). and which is operated
either automatically or manually to clean the outer surface or body of the
automobile. The author (inventor) wishes to accomplish the job of cleaning the
car with a minimum use of water, in a short period of time and with minimum
effort on the part of the car owner. This is accomplished by (1) use of a fine
cleaning spray over the surface of the car positioned so that the spray orifice
is as close to the surface of the car. The following sketch will illustrate how
this may be accomplished in one way.

The above sketch is considered self explanatory for the present. Note that this
device may be used as a manual manipulated cleaner which may be

March 22-50 Conception of Device For Cooling Flash bulbs which are used for
internal photography (within the human body): The inventor has been informed
that present methods of photographing the inside of a person prior to operating
involved the use of a flash bulb which must be intense in light energy for a
least 1/25th of a second. With the present technique the patient may receive an
internal burn which may be painful and harmful to him. The author has conceived
of the following method of cooling said bulb after it has flashed for the
photograph. The inventor wished to discipate the heat generated (most of it) by
setting up an endothermic reaction immediately after the bulb has fired and
positioned so as to the discipate most of the heat before harm is done to the
patient. Sketch of invention (preliminary design sketch)

Referring to the above skech which is a basic or primary description of the
components,

### Page 68
May 22, 1950 the light bulb (flash bulb) is connected by wires 7 to an source of
energy and switch outside the body of the patient and is encased in transparent
vial 8 so that light may penetrate (when the bulb is fired) to the ~~ various ~~
desired area. At the same instant the bulb is fired, a valve (2) is opened
allowing a fluid in chamber ~~ one ~~ (1) to enter chamber 3. A quick flow into
chamber 3 may be had by use of a liquid 9 such as Freon or other liquid with a
high vapor pressure. At the same time, valve 4 opens allowing chemical in
chamber 6 to react with liquid in chamber 3 (from chamber 1) said  reaction
being endothermic and of sufficient degree to permit discipation of heat from
bulb (5). Another possible arrangement of this device

(1) refers to chamber filled with one ~~ endothermic ~~ chemical which reacts in
chamber 8 with other chemical from chamber (2) when valve 3 is opened thus
discipating heat from bulb 5 when fired - Valve 3 may be operated by small
solenoid J. Lemelson witness H. Lemelson May 22, 1950

valve operating when point is pressed lightly against writing surface. 2. Spray
nozzles and the like: This invention consists of shaped spray nozzles made of a
porous material such as a porous material or ceramic of the correct porosity and
shape to allow for correct spray. 3. Welding Device: The object of this
invention is to provide a  of welding and poss  whereby the user may spot weld
witnessed by: Howard Lemelson, July 31,1950 Page 113 July 9,1950 thin metal
sheet and other shaped metal parts without the use of welding gases or
electricity. This device consists of a gun or instrument for dispensing a
cartridge, said cartridge containing a mixture of chemicals which will react ing
with a welding metal exothermically so as to melt said metal, at the same time
heating up the part to be welded to a sufficient temperature to allow
spotwelding of the parts, said exothermic reaction triggered by a firing pin
which sets off a fuse, said cartridge being displaced and fired by said gun;
said cartridge being held near the point of application by a clamp or jaws which
are part of said gun and made of a material such as a ceramic or other material
which will not fuse with said cartridge when it is reacting. The exothermic
reaction may  be  consist of chemicals such as  and other materials if
necessary. The inventor will discuss this matter further with a metallurgist

mechanical means or by depressurizing the reservoir of ink (just above the
reservoir) To be continued. Jerome Lemelson Sept. 29, 1950 Witnessed by: Howard
Lemelson Aug. 29, 1950 Sep. 1, 1950 The tests on the pens (pp. 111, 112) are
continuing. The pen now writing is the one which I wrote with above. It still
has not clogged with Stratford 8025 ink. Conception of Invention About a month
ago the author conceived of the following invention and he is now running tests
on some. If a material which is not soluble in water such as cellulose acetate,
pt nitrate, vinylite, paints, etc. is placed (bonded) to a bar of soap and the
soap used, the effect will be to prevent the soap from

### Page 75
Soap:  Sept. 1, 1950 dissolving directly below the material For example, the
author has painted a strip of cellulose acetate ~~ d ~~ on a flat surface of a
bar of soap. After using the soap for a while, it wore away except under the
painted strip leaving a ridge. The following applications are thus possible: (1)
Printing of letters or designs on bar soap in colored or clear plastic or other
non-soluble (water) material for decorative purposes and for advertizing the
brand name of the soap. The lettering and designs will remain and become more
bold as the soap is used (2) Protecting engravings in the soap by coating with a
wear plastic. (3) Shaping the soap (as it is used) by printing or applying
plastics or other non-soluble material. For example - if lateral shaping, strips
are ~~ sh ~~ painted on a bar of soap, after a certain amount of use. Lateral
ridges will be formed making the bar slipproof and easier to handle. Jerome
Lemelson Sept. 1, 1950 Witnessed by: Howard Lemelson, Sept. 4, 1950

September 7, 1950 Referring to the soap design invention on 121, 122 - tests
have revealed that wax dripped or placed on soap while molten will adhere to it
nicely and will serve the purposes set fourth on p. 121. As for the porous pens,
this one is still writing nicely and has been doing so since Sept. 29, 1950. The
author conceives of the following construction to keep ink out of the point when
verticle and not in use.

The soft material on the top is pressed against the porous part by gravity
preventing flow of ink thru point. By shaking, the user allows some ink to flow
to point. J. Lemelson Sept. 7, 1950 September 20, 1950 This is a sample of
writing with a porous pen containing a mixture of diazine black S.S. dye in
water. The pen has been writing now

### Page 76
for about 4 days without clogging so far. The following structure may prevent
any clogging due to paper.

Sintered metel Porous point (sealed in this area by gringing or a coating or
plating) This area on surface of pen is not sealed allowing ink to flow ~~ over
~~ from an area greater than point alone. J Lemelson Sept. 20,1950 Note. This
ink appears to be the best so far. A very small amount is dissolved in a large
quantity of water. JHL. Sept.20-50 Sept. 22, 1950 The above pen ceased writing
today. It is the opinion of the author that this is due either to surface
corosion or clogging near the surface; the possibility of it being due to paper
clogging having been eliminated: It is therefore suggested & will be carried out
that a wet tip test be run and a tip of sintered stainless steel be tried out J.
Lemelson Sept. 22, 1950

October 1, 1950 This pen has been writing now for two weeks. The tip has been
kept wet and this may be one possible solution to the problem. Any technique
which ~~ can ~~ will keep the surface of the point away from exposure to
atmosphere air may solve the problem. Capping the pen may suffice. JHL. Oct.

RECORD OF Conception of Invention: Title: MAgnetic Toy Derrick: & RELEASE
MECHANISM: Description: This toy relates to a derrick which utilizes a magnet
(permanent) to pick up toys or objects of a magnetically susceptible material
and means for releasing said objects without demagnetization. a temporary magnet
has been utilized before & in the art to accomplish this end but this requires a
source of electrical energy, usually a battery which may be worn out rapidly due
to the large current drain by the coil of the magnet. and the constant switching
on and off. Sketch:

In the drawing, a permanent magnet 1 is

### Page 12
placed in a housing 2 (of non-magnetically susceptible material) which is
secured to or part of a toy derrick arm 10. A panel 5 acts as a cover to this
housing and is spring loaded in an open position (as shown) to expose the magnet
1. The panel 5 is connected to a flexible cord ~~8 ~~ 7 at 6 and may be
triggered or released by the operator of the toy to slide over the surface of
the magnet therebye forcing (3) the object which has been picked up off the
magnet and effecting a release. J H L. Oct. 11, 1950 Conception of Invention:
Title: Bubble Blowing Pull Toy: While the following mechansim for this toy are
not worked out in exact detail below they serve to give a description- of the
general principles involved. The idea is to design a pull type toy which has the
proper mechanism for creating & blowing bubbles as the wheels of the toy turn
when the toy is rolled along the ground or pulled. In the sketch on the
following page (over).

October 11, 1950

A wire ring 1 is dipped into bubble liquid reservoir 2 by action of crank 5
which is connected to bend in axle 3, said bend 3 rotates as wheels 8 rotate.
Crank 6 also operating off axle 3 is connected to split shaft 4 which actuates
bellows 2. blowing stream of air thru ring and forming bubbles from film on ring

Lemelson Oct. 11, 1950 Oct. 13, 1950 Expanded Plastic Lifereaft (pp. 99,-100
book 1) was described today to Ira Richlin, 945 W. End Ave.

Today Mr. Cantor of Automatic Toy Co. was shown the magnetic target games (pp.
38 ff.) and a more complete model is being prepared for him. He was also shown
the sipping and (draining toy which closes an electrical contact when child
drinks) which he did not approve of. Also present in his office was an inventor
of inverted drap hanging mechanism which Cantor may manufacture.) The magnetic
toy derrick + release (p. 12) may also be made as  constructed as follows —

A magnet 1 picks up toy b. When it is ready to be released, cable or rod 4 is
pulled in direction of arrow drawing magnet into hole and forcing off toy 6. 2

October 28, 1950 The following device for remote (under the board) magnetic
control (see nov. 27, 1949) has been conceived and recorded prior to this in a
self addressed The system of moving magnets about under a thing board or playing
surface so as to move magnets in their braced about on the playing surface has
been derived. Prior (?conederations)untied a vehicle and track placed under the
board. This system utilized a belt and service of pulleys. To facilitate motion
of the belt with attached magnets, a flat belt is utilized with pulley designed
as follows. First diagram on left; reading left to right: "Playing surface,

Labels include: Belt Pulley Surface Magnet Belt Groove Pulley in cross section
Groove for magnet Oct. 28, 1950 Conception Idea: Whistling Light-up Toy —
Utilizes a switch which closes when operator blows into whistle and activates or
throws on a light in toy. (See self-addressed letter) Nov. 1, 1950 Magnetic
Switch Toy: See notebook #1 (Feb. 26, 1950) for first conception date. A
completed switch which works was completed in July and it is now being applied
to various toys and games, some of which are recorded in a mailed letter and
witnessed description (i.e. toy mine detector; toy Geiger Counter (simulated);
toy simulated electric eye; etc.).Drawings… (patent drawings) have been made and
a pat. application is in process. The author conceives that this switch may be
operated not only by magnetic attraction or repulsion from or towards the
working surface of the toy by an approaching magnet but also by motion of the
moving contact swinging (in direction lateral to the surface of the toy) or in a
direction which is radial or an axis perpendicular to the playing surface, viz:
(drawing labeled with parts 1–7) (1) Lateral to Surface: Lead in (1) connects to
stationary contact (2). Moving contact (3) has a magnet secured to it and is
caused to swing towards stationary contact (2) when magnet (7) is moved in
direction of arrow (5). (5) is lead in wire to moving contact and (6) designates
a pivot or anchor

consist of an annular ring so that (7) may merely approach (4) from any
direction for contact to be made. Above and that on page (17) have disadvantage
of not allowing a prolonged circuit closure as is that shown on page 95 of book
I. By: James H. Hamlin Note: Model of (?) p.88 book 1: Jan. 16, 1950 was
completed a month ago and will be shown to Mr. Baggott of Ideal Toy + Novelty
Co. It has also been shown to Mr. Cantor of Automatic Toy Co. who was not
interested and Mr. Marshall (drawing) of Noma Electric Co. Nov. 1, 1950.

Record of Conception of Invention: Imitation Toy Radar Set + game A toy scope I
set in a cabinet (2) has images flass across it either from a projection of a
shadow from film in optical system of (?) bulb 6 or motion of a motor driven
screen across scope (3). If the screen is utilized, scoring may be accomplished
by pointer 3' which is adjustable by knob (3) and which makes contact with
figures (5) which are painted with conductive paint and have stripes of paint
leading to a band on the side which makes contact with another slider completing
the circuit. (over)

### Page 17
(real radar) (similar real radar) To give a ~~moving effect~~ to the screen, the
scanner may have a varying degree of opaqueness with periphery by:  scanning
green (rotates) when motor is running) clear varying degree of opaqueness around

To give a moving effect to the objects, a period of bright and dark lines placed
on the scanning screen or on the scope face intermeshes with the objects on the
moving screen which are so as to give a dynamic effect (partially old art). When
light is flashed thru the transparent lines the effect is similar to real radar.
To be developed. J Lemelson Nov. 1, 1950 Nov. 2, 1950 The latest model of the
suspended magnetic target game (See book 1, p91 - Feb. 3, 1950) has completed
for Mr.Comtor of Automate Toy company. A search has been made from the Patents
gone three on target games the author believes this game is definitely
patentable. The game consists of a series of magnetic targets anchored to a base
by a flexible cord and suspended in place below other magnets. Means are
supplied for automatically suspending the targes below the magnet once they have
been knocked out of the field. Said means consist of a bar or strip with holes
in it thru which the magnet cord extends riding on dowels or rods in a verticle
plane with means of or raising the bar (with a lever or by merely packing it up
by hand) said action positioning each magnet directly below its suspending
magnet which is mounted on a cross bar. The first model was completed in July
but not recorded JHLemelson Nov,3,1950 Witnessed by H.Lemelson Nov. 10, 1950
Worked today on above mentioned target for a model for Ideal Toy and Novelty Co.
Mr. Baggot their chief engineer was informed in a personal interview of its
workshop. He expressed desires to see a model, liked the idea very much. He was
~~ las ~~ also shown (Nov 2.) drawings of

### Page 18
the egg (p.37 book 1) which springs apart when a toy chicken is placed on it, of
the convection operated lamps (tree) p 88 loops, and the crembing  device with
seventh  (recorded by mail) of which a model has been completed. Also ~~ woke ~~
have been working on (and did some work today) on a magnetic release (dated by
mail) which permits a spring loaded device to operate when a magnet is brought
near the release or may be used to operate ~~ an ~~ spring motor when a magnet
approaches the release. This latter device has been completed & will be applied
to toys. Also worked on magnetic electrical outlet for toys and the like (p 95
Feb .5, 1950 book 1) completing 3 switches; one for a toy geiger counter and one
for a mine detector game. Conception of Formations (1.) Printed circuits  for
Toy Traction. The following method of making toy roadhills, tracks, traction
surfaces etc. Is conceived as a cheap, simple appraoch to the problem of toy
vehicle control and traction. The technique would consist of printing ~~ spp ~~
sputtering, impressing a string or other method of applying a thin metallic

sheet, film or strip to a non metallic surface such as a plastic sheet, wood,
etc which ~~ to ~~ may be shaped so that a toy vehicle ~~ will ~~ (powered by an
electric motor) will seem in a desired direction ~~ down an in ~~. Said
construction would involved the use of two such strips in paralell so that
contact with these strips by the wheels of the vehicle or by other rolling or
sliding contacts will be made to supply current to the motor in the vehicle. The
vehicle would be kept on its course by meditations in the surface or by a

utilized to apply a metallic coating or strip to a non- conducting surface. 26
such individual methods are tested in National Bureau of Standard Miscellaneous
Publication #192. which includes such techniques as painting,  and spraying
conductive paints and plastics bonded powders, sputtering,

spraying molten metal & , die- cutting foil or sheet metal and attaching with
rivets staples, cement or impressing into molten or soft plastic sheet, etc. It

call today to Mr. Payne, who was quite interested in the device will verify if
the manager or owner of the company will desire to manufacture the item. A
search of my records has revealed that I possibly may have failed by error to
record this invention in detail prior to this date. the device was conceived
about the end of September 1950, a model was completed week later and a patent
drawing was completed about a week ago and copies were made by photostating. One
copy is missing from my files and I may have mailed this to my self though
misplaced it. I recall making a sketch & description which I will search for. I
am preparing a patent application on the device, at present working on the

~~prepositioning~~ attracting a series of oblong objects such as rubber stamps
(hand operated) to a rack~~s~~ and holding in place by the use of magnets, said
objects extending in a generally downward direction (hanging down), with means
provided for prepositioning each oblong object and preventing lateral
displacement. The combination of this means holding said object from swinging
sidewards or positioning in racks plus the magnetic attraction makes a simple
easy to use holding device. Said means for prepositioning and preventing lateral
displacement or swing may consist of a strip of metal at right angles to the
contact surface and circumventing the object near its upper end or
semicircumventing it if it is desired to position the object from the side, A
sketch of a typical stamp rack would be

as follows: (Similar to one of pat. drawings)

In the above drawings: a rubber stamp 1 contains a magnet 4 attached to its
handle (in the ~~ t ~~ upper end) so as to permit the stamp to hang from a
magnetically susceptible material or surface. The rack shelf 3 is of this
magnetically susceptible material or may be

attached in it around the perimeter where objects are to hang. Semi-circular
strip 2 is used as a prepositioner, and it may extend beyond the edge of 3 so
that the user turning top may has his positioning of 1 simplified. The above
rack may also be applicable to tools and the like, or any oblong objects that
can be hung by magnets. Jerome Lemelson Nov. 10, 1950 Witnessed by: H Lemelson

a month or two ago with the same device and he advised Mr. Thomas to get his
patent application first. He claimed that this Thomas had filed an application.
As a result Molin refused to give me a letter to the effect that he has seen my

May 6,1951 The following application of a free piston engine device has been
conceived. It is conceived that the free piston engine may be utilized to do
work of an oscillating nature - i.e - apply an intermittent force such as in (1)
a rivet gun (2) "compressed air" type hammer (Joels hammer), etc. The
arrangement in its simplest form would be something like the following

In the above figure, A+B refers to pistons connected by rod (1), Fuel and air
are injected into cylinder head areas (J) + (K) and ignited by spark plugs (S).
F+E refer to ~~ slide ~~ exhaust ports which are uncovered by pistons as they
advance away from head. (I) refers to ~~ spaces ~~ volumes between baffle (L)
which separates the two chambers from each other. The compression in these
volumes due to each piston advancing against plate (L) may be utilized to pum a
fluid to do work, to pump air or gases to cool the engine, to compress a fuel
for May 6-1951 fuel injection into each cylinder head, to compress an ignitable
fuel air mixture which will do work in compressing the pa gases for the next
stroke, etc Rod H extends thru a hole(well sealed) in (M) cylinder head and is
utilized to due work as the pistons oscillate back & forth. A single piston
arrangement is Spring In the drawing, Piston (P) is rigidly connected to shaft
(H) and loaded against spring (K) to maintain top dead center position
(compression) fuel is injected thru fuel injection system together with air (air
may come in thru a subpiston (not shown) in (P). which opens on the upstrobe
when ignition plug (S) explodes piston compress spring (K) when it reaches its
botton dead position it has already

slid past exhaust port (E) exhausting gases. The spring then returns the piston
to its top position, compressing incoming gases. Shaft H provides the oscilating
jabbing motion for work during operation. Note: Diaphram type metallic spring
may be  in place of coil spring shown. Volume V may be  for pumping. By Jerome
Lemelson May 6- 1951 Witnessed by: Howard Lemelson May 6, 1951 May 23- 1951 Free
Piston Engine Electric Generator It is conceived that the free-piston type
internal combustion engine may be utilized ~~ to ~~ in combination with the
necessary current producing components to produce an alternating or direct
current. Since this involves considerable development & design work ~~ in volume
~~ to arrive at an optimum operating current generating unit, only the basic
ideas for the designs will be presented at this time in this notebook pending
further ~~ full se ~~ design consideration by the inventor.

May 23-1951 The inventor is aware of prior free piston engine development by the
French Inventor Pescara whose firm has manufactured over 1000 hot air compressor
units. The free piston-type i.e. engine has numerous advantages over the
conventional piston - crank shaft engine. Simplicity of design, and fabrication,
and the possibility of ataining greater efficiencies due to less frictional
losses (no bearings, etc) and possibility of ataining higher compressibility of
fuel-air mixtures prior to ignition lable the engine type as outstanding. The
present known free piston engine designs are: A Use of two (short) free floating
pistons with combustion in three regions viz. (Pescara, German, U.S.
experimental types)

Fig. 1 In the above very simplified sketch, ~~ for ~~ a combustable mixture is
injected into zones 1, 2, & 3. This pistons oscillate back & forth as an
explosion occurs in zone 2 forcing pistons to

### Page 32
compress mixtures

### Page 33
in zones 1 & 2. At the proper instant, these mixtures are ignited forcing the
two pistons towards each other compressing a ~~ n ~~ combustible mixture forced
into that zone thru injector I2. This mixture is then ignited. forcing the
pistons away from each other again. E1, E2, E3, E4 refer to exhaust ports where
the gases are expelled or exhausted hot & at a pressure considerably greater
than atmospheric to do work. This is essentially the present day free piston
engine without the showing the more complex intake and exhaust slide valve
arragement ~~ uit ~~ utilized. If pistons 1 & 2 are designed as follows;

This whole assembly Formerly piston 1 Zone A 1a Shaft A 1b Fig. 2 it is seen
that there is a zone (Zone A) between the pistons 1a & 1b which is not in the
hot burning gas zone. If an interface or plate is places in this zone, and the
proper valving for intake and exhaust are installed, work may be done on a cold
fluid such as air, oil, etc. In addition, ~~ with ~~ Shaft A may be utilized to
do mechanical work if the interface is May 23-1951 removed. By linking or
recharge a shaft at an angle to said shaft A and extending it beyond the walls
of the engine eyelander Basic Design of Tree Piston Engine as a ColdPenny. Fig.3
shows this arrangement designed to pump cold air or fluids. The intake and
exhaust ducting are shown in very basic form. *Diagram reading left to right*
V1, V(1A) , I IB, V (1B) (1B), V2, Notevaluing is not shown from region other
than (1B) (L), E(1B) Operation may be explained as fall by looking at region 1B
between piston (1B) and separating plate (L). Combustion takes place in V2. The
assembly including piston 1B moves to the left. One way value I(1B) which is a
fluid intake value closes and exhaust value E(1B) opens permitting the fluid (as
for example) in the chambers to flow out due to the compression by piston (1B).
The combination change in region

### Page 34
V1 is then ignited forcing the assembly to the right, intake valve 1B opens
permitting fluid to be drawn in by the over expansion; at the the same time, one
way exhaust valve is forced closed. The cycle then repeats, also in the other 3
regions between the pistons and plate L. If a liquid is utilzed it may be ducted
to turn a turbine, into a fluid drive unit, do  do work as in ~~f ~~ lifting,
etc. Other components of a system utilizing a fluid would be; a hydraulic
accumulator to permit steady flow (acclimate the pulsating flour), a fluid drive
unit, etc. The designing would also include proper ducting of the unit so that
flow from each volume would follow the next for smoother flow. Use of the
freepiston engine as an impact tool has been described on pp. 40 & 41. Other
proposed uses are: a. in sawing - there is ample reciprocating oscillatory
motion to do sawing work. b. as a drill - this would require conversion of the
reciprocating motor to rotary. c. For Generating Electrical Energy: Several of
the basic design are as follows - See next page.

May 23-1951 I Placing the armature magnet (magnetic field) directly on the
piston or piston connecting shaft. Field windings would then either surround the
cylinder of the free piston engine or positioned near said cylinder or possibly
be placed inside cylinder in the zone between the pistons in such a manner that
the pistons may travel without interference One arrangement is as follows:

Since the frequency of the AC. pulses are dependent on the frequency of
oscillations of the free piston arrangements, a speed regulator device may be
necessary for constant AC. pulses, or use of a rectifier will give a direct
current. The use of sliding type brushes may enable permit use of an electro
magnet (Armature winding) to replace the permanent magnet.

### Page 35
An May 23-1951 Another arrangement is as follows. In which an extension of the
piston or (interconnecting piston rods) extends beyond the cylinder wall thru a
slot in said wall and said armature winding or permanent magnet is connected to
said extension as follows:

Motion of the permanent magnet back & forth with respect to the field windings
(which may surround the permanent magnet (slotted also) creates an alternating
current in the field circuit. Note that when compared to the conventional rotary
motor generator (combination, we see that all frictional losses in bearings,
brushes etc are not present in this arrangement More electrical energy per lb.
of fuel is derived for use. Future designs will consider complex arrangements of
the above. By Jerome Lemelson May 23, 1951 Witnessed by: Howard Lemelson May 24,

June 20-1951 The following idea was conceived today and revealed to James
Jeffress as a possible method of reducing the pressure near the exhaust of an
internal combustion engine for better scavenging. Design of the exhaust port so
that compressed gases either from the combustion chamber or from a section of
the engine in which there is a certain degree of compression pass out in the
exhaust area a high speeds therebye utilizing the principles of jet ejection to
help scavenge by reduction of pressure & carrying along exhaust gases. The

August 5-1951 (1.) Regarding a magnetic holder which was conceived last Febuary

~~m~~ by mail or in this book. I intend to utilize a permanent magnet in
combination with a correct device to secure optical instruments to a ~~cast~~
magnetically attractive base such as the flat surface of an optical bed, or an
interferometer base. This would require ~~some~~mechanism for reducing the force
of attraction between the magnet in the device and the bed ~~and~~ or for
removing the former from the bed without scratching the surface or having to
exert too much direct force. I intend to do this by either using a screw or
lever arrangement to pry the magnet off the surface or by correctly engaging and
disengaging a magnet or magnetically susceptible material to reduce the power of
the holding magnet. (2.) Regarding my ~~automa~~ remote controlled doll
mechanisms (recorded by mail) which utilize a some release in combination with

Sept 3, 1951 Sept 5, 1951 To date, approximately eight hours have been devoted
to making patent of my cargo-container winch loaded on trucks (re: pp 51, 53, 58

a patent drawings JHL Sept 10-51 filed within a few weeks. Also have been
working on a design for a lifting conveyor (platform at end of conveyor is

Worked an additional two hours on the patent drawing for the cargo container.
Included in the drawings a novel method for packaging in the body of the
container itself It consists of placing a series of inflatable cells in the
container and inflating them after the cargo is placed in the container. These
would act as (a) packing which would further secure the cargo in place (b) shock
absorbing material. This too was ~~ dis ~~ disclosed to James J. Johnson last
June and it is my hope that he hasn't gone ahead with his own development of
this. From my last meeting with him I discovered that he and his associates make
their living on royalties from patents. For this reason, coupled with the fact
that he hasn't gotten in touch with me or cooperated in the patenting of these
devices I feel that there may be come collusion taking place at present. Am
going to Washington tommorow. J. Lemelson Sept 10-J Witnessed by H. Lemelson

already talked about this and he is willing. For the record, in the event that I
haven't recorded this prior to this, I discussed another inventor last February
with Dr. Helt. It was a device for clamping and (or) holding optical instruments

- (over)

Oct. 18-1951 #1 The following ideas in toy blocks have been conceived and will
be shown to Milton Schataf who is production supervisor for Greyshaw, Inc. a
manufacturer of plastic toys and blocks. Drawings and photostats will be made:

Clear Block Wall Toy Block balls collect at bottom Plastic insert giving a path
down the wall of the block along which small balls or particles may travel when
the plo block is properly fitted A drawing is being made of this which will be
recorded witnessed and recorded by mail. Idea #2. Musical Blocks. It is proposed
to create musical notes in blocks or toys by having small pellets or balls,
falling from a storage space, empinge on a sounding board or bell. viz: See
diagram on next page.

### Page 45

Description: October 19th (continued) The small particles or balls A collect in
chamber C thru holes H in partition P which separates C from the main region R
of the clock and which forms a downwardly slanting chute with hold D, just large
enough to permit one ball to drop thru at a time. The balls A flow thru hole D
and strike bell or sounder B, thus causing a continuous series of sounds. To
return the balls to the chamber, the block is tilted on its head, balls A roll
thru hole A into C and the cycle is repeated. As a toy a ~~ multitude ~~ several
holes may be used with the balls of various sizes fallen thru respective holes
and impinging on different bells or sounders to give different notes. Jerome H.
Lemelson Oct 19- 1951 Oct 20-1951 witnessed by H. Lemelson Oct. 20, 1951 I saw
Ed Baggott of Ideal Toy Co. this morning and discussed and showed him drawings
of my patent on Toy . One of the things we discussed makes

Doll & Moving Mouth: About three months ago I conceived of a doll with a mouth
that moves as it utters a sound and recorded on a sheet which was mailed to
myself. As I showed this to Mr. Bagott Chief Engineer of Ideal Toy Company about
two months ago (Re: p. 56, Aug 51) and, he has not acted in good faith recently
regarding a mechanism which I suggested, I am recording variations on this as
follows: Baggott avoided the topic when I saw him on October 20th and I am
hereby recording these variations for my protection in the future. (1 Doll with
moving mouth and sounding mechanism. According to my original conception this
was to be accomplished by using a shaped or perforated tape on which an arm was
to ride, said arm the movement of the jaw when the doll talked. A simpler
arrangement would be to utilize a gravity operated sounder such as those used to
make a crying noise, which would operate the mouth moving mechanism. viz.

(Over)

### Page 46
Operation: When the doll is tilted, the bellows tends to return to its normal
position, Its weight is also connected to an arm which is connected by a bubage
arrangement to move the jaw when the weight drops. The anbage may cause one
movement or a more complex opening and closing of the lips synchronized with the
sound. (To be developed very shortly) Laughing Doll: A simple arrangement
whereby a doll could be made to laugh when shaken involves the use of a doll
cryer with preferably a base tone and a stroke so limited that a brief noise
will be emitted when the mechanism is tilted with the doll or when the doll is
shaken. The stroke of the bellows must me short so that the doll will not cry
when shaken or tilted but will give off a series of chuckle like noises when
shaken rapidly Another variation on this would be to drive said bellows with a
motor or by a mechanism activated by the childs winding or pulling a toy. By
Jerome Lemelson Oct 23-51 Witnessed by: H Lemelson Nov. 22, 1957 Note: the doll
thermometer of which I gave the drawings to Ed Baggott (Ideal Toy Co) on June 21
and a revision on August 5th still has not been decided upon by the people at
Ideal Toy. Baggott says that he well have defenite word for we wrltiy a week. He
claims that they want to put the stewy on a first aid or doll doctor bet. It
consisted of a colored legend or a table forced up by compressing a rubber bulb
at the dolls mouth or by a rod in a tube which is spring loaded and robich is
push up the tube when pushed against the dolls mouth. This is how recorded as
downwards curve submitted to Baggott who first claimed that they were influenced
and now claims that no decision has been made. Four months have clapped since
then. and of they do not let me know wether a week I will request... It seems to
me as if they are stalling. By Jerome Lemelson Oct 23-51 Witnessed by: H
Lemelson Nov. 22, 1957 Ideal Toy Co: I received the B.J Mehton sales manager of
Ideal Toy Company today. Shoved him four items normally. (1.) Pressure attached
toy cap (a patent has been filed by me on this) including an

### Page 47
embodyment mentioned in one of my claims, a toy figure part of which is
inflatable. I showed him a drawing of a toy dog with long ears that pop up when
a bulb is depressed, the dog being mounted on the crown of a cap. Although his
chief engineer, Mr. Ed Baggott liked this item, Michtom did not care for it.
Oct. 28- 1951 (continued) Other items shown Michtom were. (2) Toy Rocking Boat
Mechanism: This was given (drawings) to Mr. Baggott on June 21 1951 who held on
to them until now without giving me a ~~ n ~~ decision as to whether or not the
officials at Ideal liked it. He just said (on Oct 22 visit) that they already
have toy boats. Michtom however likes the idea and I will build a model. (3) Toy
Pull Fish that wiggles: Drawings of this were given to Baggott on June 21 who
did not return them to me until Oct 22. Michtom said he had seen a pull fish in
England. (4) Crying Blocks- Drawings were shown to Michtom. The toy consisted
essentially of a shaped toy block having a gravity-operated sounding mechanism.
Witnessed by: H. Lemelson 11/22/51 The figure engraved in the face of the block
would be represented by the sound. Preferably, the mouth of the figure would
have an opening to appear ~~of~~ as if the figure were talking. Michtom said he
had seen toy sounding books and was therefore not interested in these blocks. At
his point I would like to voice an opinion regarding disclosures over the past
year. 1 A drinking toy having a toy figure with a straw thru it in which the
figure drinks when the child drinks which I showed to Ed Baggott ~~ has 6 to 8 m
just ~~ a year ago and which BF Michtom likes, has just appeared on the market
(Jamison Plastics Corp, Freeport, N.Y.) Baggott turned this one down himself.
Baggott has shown bad faith in that a suggestion of mine last January regarding
a doll heartbeat mechanism which (a) requires no winding and (or) (b) requires
no mechanical motor - he expressed considerable interest in ~~ forgot about ~~
supposedly forgot about and, in his

### Page 48
Oct 28 - 51 own words, is now developing without my knowledge prior to this. In
addition, Baggott has been stalling me off regarding the acceptance of a toy
thermometer and doll {{strikethrough}}drawing{{strikethrough}} re pp.50, 54, 70)
which I gave him drawings of on back in June 21. He (Baggott) claims that Mr.
Mersky (comptroller of ideal) has seen and lies this item and that Mr. Lionel
Weintraub, also of ideal) hasn't seen it as yet but will be shown it shortly.
This stalling has been going on now for over two months and I will shortly
demand some action. One more reflection regarding Baggott On August 2nd (p53) I
showed him a drawing (recorded by mail) of a toy doll or figure with a moving
mouth. He seemed quite interested at first and then later on merely remarked
when I mentioned this item that "dolls are getting too complicated." A patent
search (my last trip to Washington) has revealed that this item is patentable. I
have just written Talking Devices Co of Chicago for information on their talking
tapes Witnessed by; H. Tomelson Nov. 22, 1951 Oct 28-51 to continue development
of this one without Baggott, it appears to me, either has a bad memory,
continally changes his mind or is approaching senility. He has not kept his
promises in regards to the cooperating in putting across the many items I
submitted to him Mr. James W. Johnson (95 Liberty St, Jovan Labs Inc Johnson was
introduced to me by Morton Friedman last Spring. of the items I discussed with
him I have mentioned: (a) Truck cargo (removable) container and (b) inflatable
packing for protecting goods in shipment together with some of the design
consideration. There is a possibility, due to the fact that Johnson has not kept
his word regarding calling me and continuing our relationship, that he (Johnson)
may be developing or patenting these items without letting me know. I am
therefore recording

production man for Greyshaw Inc. of 45 E. 20th Street (President of is Mr.
Lubars) with whom I have confided regarding developments and inventions in the
toy line for Greyshaw Inc. (described to him on Monday, Nov. 7-1951). I have

Jerome Lemelson Nov 17-1951 Witnessed by: H. Lemelson Nov 22, 1951 Note: On a
previous react to Lubras of Greyshaw Inc. I suggested the the cue of mechanical
doll trying mechanism in blocks (toy plastic, hollow blocks). He thought it was
a good idea but made no offense to me. My latest conception in this time is to
offer a series of blocks, lack to represent a different animal with a different
crier or sound written, shape the face with the animal indented have the animals
mouth open and indented clean three (a hole) the blocks to simulate a mouse
making animal. This is a variation of the doll throwing mouth (p. 69) and
another variation would be to design the mechanism shown at the bottom of p. 69
with all parts flat ~~such as the ~~ with certain of the flat parts moving as
the sounding mechanism sounds off. The toy would preferably be put in a clear
plastic case such as a block or other toy so that the parts could be more
delicately moved without danger of breaking. a toy baby crying, saying ma-ma,
pa-pa, etc. could be substituted for the animals if desired. Jerome Lemelson Nov

Target Toy : Today I mailed a model to Will Fisher of the toy shown in Fig. 5 of
my patent application on magnetic target viz: a toy figure holding on to a
string at the upper end of which is a ball (baloon) with a magnet in the top of
it. A magnet above it on a frame extending from the same base which holds the
target

### Page 53
suspends the ball in space by the metalmagnetic attraction against the tension
of the line. Other variations ~~on this~~ this principle for magnetic toys are
(a) an observation baloon (ping pong ball) suspended below a clod, (b) a rocket
on the end of the string suspended below the moon, (c) A  on the end of a string
suspended in space (d) The Hindu Indian rope trick with the rope suspended in
the described manner (e) a punching bag suspended as described and a toy figure
for knocking it out of the magnetic field, (f) the target swiveled below the
magnet so that it may spin, etc. I also mailed Will Fisher a toy block
containing a crier; my idea being to put criers in each block to teach the child
these sounds (moo-for a cowwhich is pictured on block, ma-ma, pa-pa, etc) and to
amuse him See pag. 72 Jerome Lemelson Nov. 15-1951 Witnessed by: H. Lemelson,
Nov. 22, 1951 Also Nov. 15-1951 Mr. Baggott informed me today over the phone
that Ideal is not interested in the thermometer (pp. 50, 54, 70); the reason he
gave was that the stroke of the thermometer ~~is not~~ (mechanical colored rod
which pushs in when pressed against the tips of a doll) is not great enough. In
July he told me they were working on this and would put it into their doctor or
doll first aid toy kit. Baggott has been stalling me on this one and I have
caught him being on several occasions to hold up on a final decision. I am
recording this in the event that they (Ideal) should decide to put the item on
the market. I have requested Baggott to return the photostat of the drawing I
submitted to him. When I get this I will not open the envelope but will keep it
supplement these notes in the event of future litigation. Jerome Lemelson Nov.

1952 Witnessed by: H. Lemelson 2/29/52 Feb. 13, 1952 The following items were
recently conceived. Rubber or Plastisol (polyvenyl-chloride) covered materials.
A number of items have been conceived which utilize a base item covered by a
layer of plastic material such as a plastisol (polyvenyl chloride) or rubber.
Covering the item with the rubber or rubber like layer which is actually bonded
to the surface gives it unique new qualities on permits the performing of a past
function in a cheaper and more efficient manner. and perhaps permits the item to
be fabricated more cheaply. Item (1)- ~~Plo~~Polishing or Cleaning Granule A
ball granule made either of a solid lump of a rubber or rubber like material
such as a plasticol (polyvenylchlor) (over)

Item: #2: Seal for solid containers (such as glass, etc) It is conceived that a
container and its cover which are made, for example of ~~faile~~fairly rigid
material, may be effectively sealed by coating the contacting surfaces with a
rubber or rubber like material such as a plastisol and possibly shaping the
surfaces for most efficient operation. If the proper machines are perfected to
apply the plastisol, self sealing glass jars which do not require rubber washers
may be bad; viz: SEAL #1

Feb. 28, 1952 The following items have been: conceived and are now first being
recorded as I am planning to work for one of the machine design companies or job
shops (engineering) and will most likely have to sign a patent agreement similar
to the one I signed for Design Service Company but which is now void as I am no
longer working for them. FORMING DIES: a die for forming thin sheet and of metal
and other formable materials has been conceived utilizing magnetic fluids or
fine particles which are frozen in shape by magnetic forces and then ~~ as ~~
utilized as male and (or) female dies to form the material. The procedure for
their fabrication would be as follows.

(A)~~form to be stamped~~shape to be formed C partition (A) partition (B)
magnetic fluid (particles) (fluid to be heated for thermo forming of plastics,
etc.) Housing ~~ The housing is placed in a magnetic field A magnetic field is
produced around the housing after the form (A) is inserted as shown with a
partition (B) surrounding the form so that the two halves of the die may be
separated when frozen by the magnetic ~~ field ~~ forces. The die halves are
then separated, a sheet of material to be formed is placed between them and they
are brought together in a press to make the resulting form. Coils of magnetic
field producing may actually run thru magnetic fluid: c for added field strength
Impact Forming: It is conceived that thin sheets may be bent or formed about a
die by causing a fluid to impinge at great dynamic pressure (as in impact)
against the sheet which is placed over a male or female form. The whole
operation would preferably ~~viz.~~ take place in a closed vessle. Witnessed by:

fits. From fig. 2 it can be seen that the compressed washer ~~ woul ~~ seals off
the space under the head after the rivet is set. Variations: The following
variations of this principle have been conceived: (2) washer close to shanks:

Conception of Invention: The following ideas regarding plastics, there
processing and treatment have been conceived. In general the ideas have been
conceived as a result of the recent announcement about the "plastigels" (re:
Modern Plastics Magazine" Jan 1952, putty-like' plastic substances which may be
formed at room temperature under low pressure and hardened at temperatures of
300° to 400°F. It is conceived by the author that a variety of new products and
applications June 4-1952 of these plastigels may be made. In particular, the use
of "electronic" heat may be utilized to fabricate these new products ~~and p~~
and a variety of new processes. At this writing , the ideas may be broken down
into the following categories. I. Plastigels ( or other plastics) combined
mechanically with other compounds for (a) new uses and effects and (b) color
combinations of plastigels to create new effects and products II. New ~~teh~~
techniques for fabricating plastics such as plastigels by radio or electronic
heat III. Fusing plastigels with ultrasonic waves. Describing in more detail: I.
Plastigels combined and processed with soft vinyl (poly vinyl chloride. A number
of new products are conceived at present from time to time I expect to add
others to the following list: (a) As a ridgitizing or reenforcing agent. (1)

June 4-1952 and adhere by fuzing with the base material. Note: For the
aforementioned applications and those to follow, a thermosetting plastic may
conceivably be utilized. However, it is the belief of the writer that the
plastigels are best suited for the application, as they are easily handled at
room temperature at low pressure. (2) Button formed on vinyl of plastigel: A

that Pilot Plastics Company of Paterson, N.J. is now manufacturing an assembly
toy having the embodyment of an invention which was conceived by me over a year
ago. According to my records I have a stamped sealed envelope dated August 30,
1951 which contains drawings and a description of my toy "Springs 'n Things"
which comprises a toy figure assembly kit having parts representing the head,
torso, feet, etc. joined by limb members which are springs giving the toy a
dynamic effect I have been working on the patent application for this for the
past four months and it is just about completed and ready to file as this is
written One reason for the delay in filing was due to the fact that ~~ I ~~
after ~~ discover ~~ building models I discovered the toy figures to be unstable
due to the fact that the leg members were flexible and, as they were made of
plastic wire springs, they were not able to form a stable figure. I solve this
in my patent application by utilizing heavy foot members or foot members which
are suction cups, an arrangement which I only conceived about five months ago.
However the figures could be assembled

with rigid leg members and highly flexible arm and neck elements. Jerome

the mechanism which is classified as a "delay release catapult mechanism". It
comprises essentially a spring loaded arm 1 pivotably mounted on a base 7 having
a suction cup 4 secured to one end thereof and a holding means 5 for the object
6 to be catapulted. A suction cup 4 secured to the end of 1 is pressed against
the surface of 7 against the tension of spring 3. After a brief delay, the
spring 3 tension overcomes the suction cup holding force and the arm swings up
in the direction of the arrow A causing the ball 6 to be catapulted. Note: the
suction cup 4 may be replaced by a ~~ pie ~~ lump of tacky substance such as tar
or gum which holds down arm 1 until the tension of the spring over comes it. The

Oct. 30-1948 have been conceived by the author in connection with his work in
jet propulsion for Project Squid at New York University. These records are being
kept by the author for the following purposes. 1. As a reference aid to the
author in his future work. 2. To establish a date of conception for possible
patent application in the future in devices relating to jet engine designs. 3.
To establish proof that the author has conceived of, and, is the inventor of
these various devices. In such cases where the author has collaborated with
others on the project with such designs, or where other persons are solely
responsible for the design, the author will make mention of such in writing.

JAN. 31-1949 On this date the author conceived of a method of cooling and
preserving the grid structure. One of the experimental grids (made of 3/8" sheet
brass) melted during operation of the engine. To protect the grid, the author
suggests that fuel to be introduced in the primary and secondary region thru
this grid. This might be the point which will make the grid workable in the

April 14 – 1950 Process For Finishing Aluminum with a Lustrous or Polished
Surface: The author proposes the following process for putting a highly
reflective and polished surface on aluminum and aluminum objects. It is the
desire to such a process where aluminum is to be used as a structure and as an
ornamental surface. At the time of this writing, no method has been developed
whereby aluminum may be chrome plated. The following technique may serve the
purpose and experiments will be conducted to ascertain if it may be successfully
and satisfactorily accomplished. ~~ Ch ~~ Step I — Chroming the aluminum surface
either by the present techniques or by the development of a technique whereby
the process may be accomplished at a lower temperature (solution temperature).
Step II — Polishing the chromised surface by: (a) Mechanical buffing (b) Acid
cleaning and polishing (c) Buffing or polishing the surface by using a fine
grained polishing or buffing compound suspended in a jet of high velocity steam
or air. This

would differ from sand blasting in that the working particles would be much
finer, they would be suspended in a liquid, fluid such as steam or other gas
which would be ejected through small nozzles at a very high velocity, impinging
on the surface and polishing it. Jerome Lemelson Apr. 14, 1950

materials with x-rays, or high energy electrons to change their physical
characteristics. Ordinary polyethylene for example when irradiated changes to a
more durable plastic when irradiated with electrons in the range of several
million electron will be increased in its ability to withstand heat, improved in
durability, hardness, etc. An article (page 1, column 8 of July 18th 1956 issue
of the Wall Street Journal) mentions that Ford Motor Company can concentrate
dye~~ s ~~ change ~~ to ~~ neutral white paint, etc to colored paint by playing
a controlled radiation (electron) gun over the paint. The following are methods
of are~~ a ~~ radiating a specific part of an article, leaving the rest of the

Fig. 1 shows an article of manufacture (A) which is made of a plastic or other
material, or coated with a ~~ m ~~ paint whereby said material or coating
exhibits improved physical characteristics and (or) change of color or shade
after irradiation by high energy electrons or other atomic particles such as
those produced b a Van der Gaff generator A mask (M) is positioned between said
article (A) and a source (SR) of said radiation, said mask acting to absorb all
or part of the energy fro SR except at an opening(s) H in said Mask. The surface
of (A) opposite the opening H thus receives a greater degree of radiation than
the rest of (A.) The mask may be made of any material which will absorb the
desired degree of said radiation for a given thickness. It may be made of lead,
or any suitable metal. It may also comprise photsenstive glass or plastic having
one or more developed or etched areas thereof ~~ thru ~~ capable of absorbing
more of the radiant energy from the source SR than the other areas thereof.
Another conceived use of such a mask and process of radiation is in the
manufacture of articles of plastic having different areas of a single shape with
different physical characteristics. Jerome Lemelson 3/15/56 Witnessed NJ 7/18/56

As stated, ordinary polyethylene when irradiated with high energy atomic
radiation, x-rays, etc. becomes more rigid and exhibits improved physical and
chemical characteristics By using a mask of the types illustrated on p.30, a
sheet of polyethylene plastic may be produced by radiation which has an area of
thereof which is rigid and an area or areas which are flexible (not irradiation
or not as much irradiated as the other). A multitude of new products are
conceived with such a construction such as (a) plastic clothing, containers,

than a thousandth of an inch thick or several ~~ so ~~ thousandths of an inch ~~
is ~~ thick will serve as an excellent material for 10 which will not tear or
bend easily. The ~~ materi ~~ sheet 10 may be made of transparent plastic which
has been metallized or otherwise rendered highly light reflective so that
ambient light striking the surface of the flap 11 will be reflected in different
directions as said flap moves and will provide essentially an ~~ lig ~~ area of
scintillating light to an observer who is ~~ fo ~~ viewing said ~~ sig ~~
display sheet 10 The design of the flap 11 is such that it hangs downward from a
narrow neck 11' and is joined by said neck to the sheet 10. The neck 11 is
preferably of such a dimension that the degree of ambient or surrounding

breeze used to displace the flap 10 will effect its motion without effecting
permanent deformation of said material or tearing it at said neck 11' so that
the ~~ love ~~ lower section 11" of the flap 11 will return to a pre ~~ deformed
~~ displaced position and hang by gravity when no breeze or air is present or
will swing in the other direction relative to the sheet 10 as illustrated in the
edge view Fig 2 when the direction of the ambient breeze shifts. The neck 11'
thus acts as a cantilevered spring which coacts with the weight of the lower
section 11" of the flap 11 to return the flap to its predisplaced position. ~~
Th ~~ The numeral 15 refers to a cut-out or area of the sheet 10 which has been
removed around the flap or petal 11 so that its edges will not bend and it is
free to swing. The area 15 is preferably at least several thousandths of an inch
across and extends from the neck 11' completely around 11 Several MHB 7/31/56

designs for the flap 11 are illustrated in Fig. 1 and are referred to by the
numerals 12, 13, and 14. The flap or petal 12 is rectangularly shaped; 13
triangular shaped as compared to the pear shaped petal 11. The numeral 14 refers
to a flap, rectangularly shaped, which is formed in 10 by providing a ~~ simple
~~ slit or cut 15' in ~~ 10 ~~ said sheet without providing the previously
described cut-out area 15. Such a petal design may be used as an effective
display device if (a) the area 15a where the flap 14 joins the sheet 10 is
deformed with a bend 15a^ in it so that the petal 14 normally hangs away from
the sheet 10^ in Fig. 3 or (b) if the sheet 10 is mounted so that is is oblique
with horizontal and the weight of 14 keeps said flap ~~ in ~~ at an angle to 10,
so that it will swing in the breeze without being engaged with the sheet 10 in a
manner to prevent its motion. Jerome H Lemelson July 24, 56 July 31, 1956 Fig. 2

features of a display incorporating ~~ the ~~ one or more of the petals of Fig.

horizontally extending beams 16, & 17 secured to the verticle beams 17^ near the
borders of said sheet by fasteners, cement, or other means It is noted that the
single frame of Fig. 2 may be replaced by a rigid lattice work made of multiple
rigid strips and with sheet 10 so secured ~~ on ~~ thereof that ~~ the ~~ each
flap or petal is free to swing as illustrated by the dotted lines of Fig. 4.
Fig. 4 may represent ~~ the lattice ~~ such a lattice mount for the sheet 10 in
crossection whereby the area 10 represents horizontal crossmembers joined to one
or more verticle crossmembers. Fig 4 may also represent another construction
whereby the numeral 18 refers to a single board against which the then plastic
sheet 10 is secured. A hole 19 is provided in 18 behind each petal 11, so that
said petal may swing freely thru said hole when a breeze impinged against the

impinging against either side of 18 while said board provides rigid support for
10 and prevents at (10) from deflecting with the wind, thus providing an
efficient display device. While the numeral 25 of Fig. 1 refers to the
metallized area of 10, the numeral 21 refers to an area adjacent to 22 which may
be a different color or not light reflecting. This may be effected by masking or
painting over the area 21. It is noted that such a construction may be used to
form a display of different colors on the viewing surface of 10 or to provide a
simple and low cost means of providing a design on 10 such as in an alphabetical
letter or numeral without the necessity of cutting said sheet to the required
shape. Of somewhat application of the display is as a base for a sign whereby a
large sheet 10 is provided Jerome Lemelson 7/31 56

with a multitude of said petals 11 cut therein and closely spaced. For a highly

Device #1

Fig. 1 In fig. 1, two shock tubes DT-1 and DT2 are placed end to end in endwise
alignment so that the shockwaves SWN-1 and SWN2 created in each will approach
each other. By timing the formation of each shock in the upstream end of its
respective tube they may be made to appear at the working zone ZN (located at
the end of each tube) at essentially the same time. The fluid in zone ZN will
thus be compressed by the action of both waves converging thereon. If the waves
SWN1 and SWN2 are created by resonating effects in each tube (i.e.- if each tube
is the exhaust end of a pulse jet, free piston engine exhaust or any type of
tuned or J.H.L. 3/21/57 M.B. Friedman 3/21/57

as a result of said resonation) and if both tubes are operating in
synchronization with each other (i.e.- the intermittent or repetitive shocks ~~
waves arrive ~~ waves arrive at ZN at the same time) then both tubes will act
essentially as closed end or quarter wave tubes as the shocks will reflect off
each other upon impact ~~ and travel ~~ or intersecting and travel back the
tubes. Valves V-1 and VE are secured to the walls of the joined tubes DT-1 and
DT-2 adjacent said working zone ZN and are adapted to respectively admit and
exhaust a fluid to said zone. The notation W-1 refers to a fluid in duct P-1
prior to entry into said zone ZN and W-2 to the fluid exhausted from zone ZN.
This fluid (i.e. the fluid entering thru valve V-1 may be the same as that
already in the shock tubes or it may be a different fluid. The fluid in JHL

are provide to inject a fluid or fluids into the working zone and remove the
resulting fluid therefrom both preferably operating to open and close at
predetermined rate or otherwise as described. In Fig. 3, the working zone ZN"
comprises a chamber of greater crossection than the duct DT into which a greater
volume of fluid may be infected at any angle and in which said fluid may collect
(if a liquid or residue) such as in the illustrated sump zone SZ. It is noted
that such a chamber may be provided in the working zone ZN of Fig. 1 between the
two shock tubes DT-1 and DT-2 In Fig. 3, the fluid infector or valve V-1 is
shown mounted so as to inject said fluid at essentially right angles to the
shock waves generated in the duct DT. Said fluid may be injected in this manner

said shock waves will eventually form an equilateral pyramid of decreasing
volume with a center the center of the sphere. By injecting a fluid ot flowable
material thru a fifth duct P-1 towards the center of the sphere said fluid may
be caught between said four shocks and will be greatly compressed by the action
of all four shocks converging on said fluid. Multiple injection ducts or nozzles

Methods of Extruding Aluminum etc July 8, 1957 The following ideas have been

thickness save at one or more plug like sections 42 ~~of~~ which close off the
interior of said tube as shown and are an integral formation of the material of
said wall 40. The solid sections 42 are formed by axial manipulation of the
mandrel utilized to extrude said tubing in the extrusion die in the manner to be
described. Said sections 42 may be provided to serve one or more of several
purposes. They may be used to strengthen or stiffen said tubing per se in or in
~~area~~ lengths thereof where greatest loads are to be exerted such as at ~~p~~
sections where other structural members are to be secured thereto and exert a
load thereon. The solid sections 42 may be provided where it is desired to drill
partially or completely thru the walls of said tubing for securing it to other
members with fasteners or the like

or where it is desired to weld, braze or solder said tubing to other members.
The solid section when machined or operated on will provide a structure much
stronger than the thinner and weaker tube wall 40. Since section 42 may be made
solid thru and thru the wall thickness of the rest of the tubing may be less
than conventional tubing used for the same purpose. Sections 42 may be provided
at equal distances along the length of the tube and serve as stiffeners for the
walls thereof or at predetermined points in the length of the tube in accordance
with the later fabrication requirements of said tube. If the tubing 15 is to be
used as a fluid conductor, or storage medium one or more sections 42 may be used
to confine the fluid to a length of the tube and may also be used as a base for
securing a fluid

drilling radially and axially in the plug section 42 or oblique to the

a tube 40a formed in the manner in which tube 40 was shaped with a plug-section
42 of greater length than 42 of Fig. 8. If the tube 40a. is cut along the plane

in one end of thereof the chamber 14 thereof and held by an end plate 13. The
expressing of a flowable material such as aluminum is effected while said
material is in a molten or semi-fluid state at ~~ heated below its molten state
or cold by conventional means. In the apparatus of Fig ~~7  1 a piston 20
travels longitudinally in the chamber 14 by the action of one or more hydraulic
cylinders 27, which is shown with

its ram 26 connected to the rear section 22 of piston 20 via two or more rods 25
and a yoke plate 24. The rods 25 travel axially in bearings in a base plate 19

urged in reciprocating motion therein, so that its far end travels in and out of
the bore in the die block 12, by the ram 18' of a second hydraulic cylinder 18

36 whereby a slot 37 is formed in the extruding wall of the extrusion 15’ as it
~~ ex ~~ is formed. When the tapered nose 30b of the tool 30” is retracted to
the position of Fig. 8 the cylindrical tube ~~ shown ~~ section illustrated is
extruded. The numeral 35 refers to a cavity on the surface of mandrel 36 for
receiving and supporting the tip ~~ 30b of the stop-tool 30’ when the latter
projects across the die opening. This insures that the cavity 35 may not be
eliminated if the tool

tip 30b is strong enough to resist breakage during extrusion provided that the
end of 30b is shaped to the contour of the surface of mandrel 36 and it abuts
said surface when a thru slot 37 is desired. If a cavity 35 is provided it is
preferably without walls to abutt and support the end of 30b against
longitudinal (axial) displacement during extrusion and is provided ~~ preferably
in the surface of 36 at ~~ at ~~ a point near the end of 36 beyond which the
tubing has already formed so that extruding material will not flow into said
cavity but will flow over following the outer surface of the mandrel. Jerome

Sept. 1, 1957 Additional Material to Be Added to the specification of the
invention of pp. 16–77 p. 71 to end of page add (A) Also shown in Fig. 71 is a
marking device 39 secured to the frame 2 of the press and positioned adjacent
the extruding tube 15 for providing a mark on the exterior of said tube which is
indicative of the variations in internal crossection. For example, if a solid
plug-like member section 42 is formed at a particular length or section of the
extrusion said section may not be easily discernable from the exterior of the
tube by visual means and tube is not made of a translutransparent material. It
may therefore be desirable to mark the section of the tube where the section 42
occurs in the event it is desireed to drill thru or cut into the section 42. The
marker 39 may be any well known marking device which is solonoid operated and
may comprise simply a solonoid stamp for putting an indented mark in the
exterior wall of 15 as it moves past. (A)

two or more stop-extrusion tools may be provided side by side to produce when
acting c together, either a series of spaced apart or side-by-side holes in any
particular face of the extrusion or to produce d a single hole of width which
varies according to the number of tools covering the die opening. The latter

Sept. 25-1957 I visited American Art Works at their Coshocton, Ohio Plant today
and discussed technical aspects of my Display Device (applications 260,954 & SN,
616,089) with their management personnel including Mssrs. M.P. Murphy, Bob Huey,
Bob Cantor, a Mr. King and their art director. They claim they would like to
work on a commercial model before a final decision regarding ~~ use ~~ licensing
it from me can be made. I suggested the following: (1) Border sealing of the
plastic lens ~~ e ~~ sheet to the base sheet to hermetically seal the interface
against moisture & weathering by (a) A plastic coating over the border openings
(b) Heat or electronic sealing means (c) Compression of the plastic sheet
between a folded border of the sheet metal base combined if necessary with (a).
I also suggested that a relatively low index of refraction cement or

plastic be used for bonding the scotch lite to the lens sheet (i.e. - an alkyd
resin or the like) I also gave them ideas concerning the manufacture of large
signs such as by latching a number of square or rectangular segments made
separately together or by light (movement) scanning means or intermittent
exposure of different areas to create the silk screen master. Further
suggestions were made relating to the material already submitted to them. Jerome

### Page 53
me that a decision would be forthcoming from Mr. Wilbening in a few days after
he sees the model. Jerome H. Lemelson Feb. 22, 1958 March 2, 1958 I visited Mr.
Nick Argiro at his home at 780 Riverside Drive, N.Y.C. Apt 10F today. He showed
me a number of new toys he had just licensed to Holgate Toys which will be
displayed at the Toy Fair in a week including six new items (a skiperaper
consisting of flat slate with an array of holes held apart by ~~ tu ~~ short
tubes of wood in a simple wooden rod secured to a base, slats to be made of rib
reenforces plastic sheets instead of masonite as originally designed; a wooden

Suburban Toy Company of Pittsburgh, Pa who had accepted two of his toy designs
JL March 2, 1958 Lenore Waldmeyer March3, 1958

a rubber bulb activated baseball pitcher and a swatting baseball on a string. It
seems that Nicks present partner Ernest Swimmer knows an associate (described as
the general foreman) of Novelty Manufacturing Company, Newark, N.J. I disclosed
ideas for my delayed action movement toys (patent pending) ~~ and n ~~ including
the patent drawing, several other drawings and a model of the delayed action
ball pitching game. Sal Berger signed an agreement with me last summer before
seeing the item, and the drawings, not to disclose it to anyone and to keep the
idea confidential. Apparently his foreman or one of his associates told and
described the idea to Ernest Swimmer. According to Argero, Swimmer told Suburban
Toys president about the item and Argero believes Suburban may make it. Argero
offered Jerome Lemelson Mar. 2, 1950 LW 3/3/58

### Page 54
to take my model to Suburban Toy but I informed him that it is presented under
consideration by Wilkening I also informed Argero that I have other designs for
the catapult including a rocket launching platform, target game, Jack in the
box, etc. Argero informed me that he had just developed a rocket launcher to
sell for about 3.00 retail to Kohner Brothers. He also informed me that his
present partner, with whom he is negotiating a split in their partnership, told
the president about the delayed action catapult, as stated, and while it is not
stated for production this year there is a possibility it may be produced next
year. If this happens, Argero plans to attempt to have Suburban pay him under
the agreement they have with him for his baseball pitcher. All this appears to
be quite confusing to the writers who recalls that Sol Berger proprietor of
Novelty Manufacturing Company J.L. March 2, 1958 LW 3/3/58

mentioned he knew the fellows who developed a baseball pitching game when I
showed him my baseball pitcher last summer and I recall informing him (Berger)
that under no circumstance must they be informed of my invention. He agreed and
signed the agreement. I intend to discuss this matter with attorney, Jerry

species therein may be marketable such as the pin-ball components, printed
circuit structure, etc. (2.) March 5, 1958 I intend to work on the following toy
inventions as soon as I get time. (1.) Floating target game. This game is based
on the Bernouli effect of floating a light ball in an airstream, viz.

The balls A and A' which may be ping pong or styrofoam balls less than 1" in
diameter are floated on streams of air ejected from tubes B and B' which are
connected to the hollow sphere C. The sphere C may be pressurized by means of a
balloon (D) or by a pump P feeding air thru a line L. and then thru base D into
C. A rotary seal in accordance with my (Fig. 5 patent # 2654973 may be provided
between C and D and the assembly which includes C, B and

Art Lerner AM 3-25-58 MBF 7/15/58

B' may be rotated on (D) by air pressure, air being ejected in a plane
perpendicular to the axis of rotation by means of holes near the ends of B and
B' also in accordance with my patent 2654973. An electric motor may be used to
drive the pump P as well as rotate C ~~ and ~~ on D.

This is a verticle crossection of such a toy object is to shoot balls A, A' out
of supporting streams with a pellet. Jerome H Lemelson March 5-1958 Also
conceived on March 5-58 are the following designs for target games utilizing the
Bernouli effect (over) MBF 7/15/58 AM 3-25-58

bearings 18, 18' ad has a flat spur gear 20 secured to its bottom surface. The
flat spur 20 is engaged by a small circular spur gear 22 driven by a motor 24
also secured to frame 10'. Thus rotation of 22 by motor 24 will cause the tube
16 to travel longitudinally in bearings 18, 18'. The motor 24 may be an
automatic reversing motor or ~~ an automatic reversing spur gear drive with air
shaft input which turning in one direction by the motor may be employed one or

- 1958 I have had a number of meetings with Nick Argiro in the past four weeks
and yesterday presented him with an agreement pertaining to his work on models
of ideas and inventions I would submit whereby we would share in any royalties
received on the developed

product. Also discussed with Argiro while at the Toy Fair, ~~ and ~~ last week
and yesterday were the following ideas. (1) Some variations in my delay Action
Release Toys (re: pp. 94 to 97 of this book) which Nick is quite anxious to
handle He desires to show one or more of these ideas to Hassenfeld Brothers yet
hasn't mentioned the ball pitcher to Mr. Faloon of Suburban Toy Company. Also
mentioned and described to Argiro where my ideas for employing the delay action

of variations on my Delayed Action Release Toys and a model. He agreed
beforehand to sign my standard agreement and the drawings, but he signed the
agreement but refused to sign any of the drawings after seeing them staling that
he debut want to get involved in the future in a law suit if he should like any
of the ideas without my delayed action suction cups mechanisms. I feel there is
considerable novelty in the baseball pitcher, batter, football player, bowler,
basketball player, and the others outside of the release mechanism. Jerome H
Lemelson March 25, 1958 I have this 26th day of March read and understood the
material contained on page 97-106 of this notebook. Jerome W. Berliner March
26-1958 The air operated target apparatus of pages 98 to 102 was described to

107 Met Arguro at the Toy Fair. When he mentioned the he had seen Kusan's
satellite train I told him that I had received a patent for a jet propelled for
a toy cap (2,654,973 patent) which could be applied to such a principle and that
I had recorded a design for such a target game just a few weeks prior to the Toy
Fair in my notebook. He agreed that it would be a good thing to work on and I
intend to work-up some detailed design sketches of the toys very shortly. Jerome
Lemelson March 26, 58 I read and understood the material at the bottom of the
page 106 and above of this notebook on the 26th of March 1958. Lenore Waldmeyer

### Page 59

would, if he chooses, produce models of the designs. He has failed to sign the
agreement and has not called me. I therefore see fit to record a few more ideas
I disclosed to him in the past few weeks when I had hoped we would work out
together in the future. (1) Ball Manipulation Same ref. p103 I showed him a
model of the game in my pending application and mentioned that it should be
provided as part of a cereal box with the foamed plastic ball inside. I also
mentioned that the embodiment of my application could be made of vacuum ed
formed plastic sheet. (2) Magnetic Target Game- I left my model of this game
with him (at his home several weeks ago) and mentioned that the target could be
made to rotated by rotating the suspending magnet or Nov 31, 58 LW B 4/2/58

to oscillate by moving the suspending magnet or using an electromagnet with a
varying voltage within its coil. I also mentioned that this could be used as a
satellite toy. Jerome Also mentioned for a variation in the Ball Manipulation
game was the use of a totally enclosed vacuum formed surface under a transparent
plastic sheet. Jerry Lemelson March 31, 1958 I also mentioned to Nick that I
have an application pending which includes a constructional toy having foamed
plastic slabs joined by elongated pins to form the floors and roof of a building
and/or walls of a building. Jerry Lemelson March 31, 1958 Mar 31,58 LW. April
1-58 farther recall that in conversing JB 4/2/58

### Page 60
about the Ball Manipulation Game with Nick Argus I mentioned that I had
conceived of possible names for the game such as Huff-n-Puff Baseball, Football,
Basketball, etc. I also mentioned that the vacuum formed construction using a
playing surface formed of sheet plastic with a sense of indentations, ridges, ~~
etc ~~ holes, etc for manipulating or rolling a ball across could be used with a
marble or other ball in a variety of different types of games, the construction
being singular to that shown in my pending application entitled Ball
Manipulation. Some with the upper surface of the sheet shared with said
irregularities, hollows or holes. Jerome Lemelson April 1, 1958 Record of
Conception of Invention. The following designs for the construction of bubbling
Christmas tree lights are conceived to simplify the method of JB 4/2/58

manufacturing such tubes and lowering their cost as well as improving their
operation and producing new optical effects & therefrom Design #1 Fig.1 S In
Fig. 1 is shown an improved design for a heat operated bubble-tube 10 having a
heater element in the from of an electric lightbulb 10 having a heater element

14 is an elongated glass tube ~~ 20 ~~ 22 having a cylindrical wall ~~ 22 ~~,
which is closed at the top 22' and separated from the volume of the bulbous
bottom section 12 by a ~~ the ~~ partition 23. Disposed in the bottom of 20 and
preferably adhered to the upper surface of 23 is a small quantity of porous
matter 24 for the formulation of bubbles in the liquid L ~~ 26 pa ~~ which
partially fills the entire volume 26 of tube 20 under reduced pressure. The
liquid ~~ 26 ~~ L may be ~~ any ~~ such refrigerants as methyl chloride,
chloroform, methylene chloride, Freon, or the like. A pale and non toxic liquide
is Freon 113,

Chlorobromomethane is hereby proposed as a new liquid for bubble tubes which
will satisfactorily suit the purpose for generating bubbles therein but is also
a good fire extinguishing agent the vapor of which will easily smother any fire
in the vicinity of the tube when released therefrom

When the bulb is lighted as current flows thru filament 17 heat is radiated
therefrom to the partition 23 and conducted therethru to the mass 24 ~~ and ~~
said heat causes liquid ~~ ending ~~ filling the pores or crevases ~~ therein to
~~ in 24 to boil and vaporize. Pockets of vapor form which, when they grow large
JB 4/2/58

enough escape as ~~ pockets or ~~ bubbles B from the mass 24. The one piece
construction of Fig. 1. has numerous advantages over conventional bubble tubes
employing a light bulb and a separate bubble tube positioned with its bottom
close to or against the upper face of the ~~ b ~~ light bulb and held by means
of a shell or coupling member which ~~ hides can~~ engages the base of the light
bulb and the base of the tube. Quite often this two piece construction results
in an assembly in which the bottom of the bubble tube does not make contact with
the upper surface of the light bulb ~~ and the ~~ with the result that not
enough heat will be ~~ tran ~~ conducted to the bottom of the bubble tube and
the latter will fail to generate bubble when the light is on. The construction
of Fig. 1 eliminates the necessity of using a securing means such JB 4/2/58

### Page 62
As the mentioned, coupling member and the tube 20 is always securely mounted and
always adapted to receive ~~ light he ~~ heat from the light bulb filament with
a high degree of efficiency of heat transfer. The wattage required of lamp 12
may therefore be lower than ~~ used in conventional bubble tubes ~~ the wattage
required for operating a conventional ~~ two ~~ assembled bubble tube device.
Since it may not be desired to have the entire light from the bulb section 12 to
directly shine into the eyes of the observer, all or part of the inner or outer
surface of bulb 14 may be coated with our opaque or translucent plastic or other
masking material, ~~ 14 ~~. The ~~ notation 14" refers to to said coating which
may extend over the surface of 14 in all but small areas thereof to give the
effect of small, light sources and preferably does not coat a band like area 14"
a ~~ circumscribing the bottom of 20 so that part filament 17 will be permitted
to be directed upward thru and against the walls of tube 20 and JB 4/2/58

Will reflect off the walls of the bubbles formed in the liquid The numeral 25
shows reinforcing ribs or thickening of the wall of the glass structure where
the tube section 22 joins the bulb section 14. 25 may also comprise a plurality
of integrally formed gussets joining the base of 22 and 14 which may also serve
as means for ~~ direct ing ~~ly directing light upward ~~ thru ~~ therethru ~~ g

which travels up tube 22. The need for providing a porous mass for generating
bubbles is thus eliminated. After the bubble has formed and travels up the tube,
liquid from above will flow into the restricted volume of ~~ 22 b’ ~~ 27 and
will remain there until heated once more so that it vaporizes. S In Fig. ~~ 3‘

less. If the restricted ~~ ? ~~ volume 29 ~~ 22 b’ ~~ is sheet0like in shape, a
still greater area of liquid in 26 will be heated from two sides to a degree
where it vaporizes and forms bubbles. In Fig. 5 the bubble tube section 22
tapers downward and outward as shown and smoothly conforms with the

end ~~ 14a ~~ 32’ of the glass lamp 12'. The light bulb section 12' is formed at
its upper end with an upwardly projecting conical wall ~~ 14b’ ~~ 3' which forms
a partition between the upper enclosed volume 26 and the volume 12C within the
light bulb section 12. Thus part of the light generated in 12C when 17 glows to

lower end of volume 26 and if the liquid in 26 is in motion, a shimmering effect
to the eye will be produced by refraction. If bubbles are generated in 26c they
will produce scintillating areas of light reflection as they move up the tube.
Bubbles may be produced in volume 26C' either by tapering or restricting the
