April 11-19 1958 Record of Conception of Invention I. Designs for and methods
and making molds and molding apparatuses. S In the art of molding hollow bodies
out of liquid plastic materials such as vinyl plastisols and organisols, said
bodies are usually make by what is known as slush or rotational molding. ~~
wherein ~~ In these techniques, a measured quantity of liquid plastic is poured
into a closed mold thru an opening therein and the mold is rotated in one or
more directions as it passes thru a furnace. The walls of the mold become hot
while in the furnace and the plastic which contacts the entire surface thereof
as the mold rotates, cures to the shape of the exterior of the mold. After a
predetermined time ~~ when ~~ the mold emerges from the furnace and the excess
plastic, if any, is poured off. If no excess plastic is present, the hollow body
is ~~ may be ~~ pulled from the mold thereafter. The use of a furnace for
heating the mold has certain

### Page 5
disadvantages and shortcomings. In addition to the waste of a considerable
amount of heat not  a radiated to the molds, heat is lost where the molds enter
and leave the furnace. Furthermore a complex conveying system must be provided
for moving the molds into and out of the furnace which is costly and difficult
to maintain. Accordingly, it is a primary object of this invention to provide
new and improved apparatus for molding hollow bodies of liquid, heat cured
plastic. Another important object is to provide improved apparatus for molding
hollow bodies  of  from liquid heat cured plastic which  o  requires a minimum
expenditure of heat to form said bodies without the need for a large furnace and
conveying system. ST Other objects and advantages of this invention will become
apparent from the following specifications and claims which relate to the
drawings where: Fig. 1 is a

THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER WITNESSED & UNDERSTOOD BY J. Berliner DATE 4/21/58 Alan
A Meyerhoff 4/22/58 Fig. 1 S The apparatus of Fig. 1 comprises a two piece mold
10 consisting of mold half sections 10-a and 10-b which, when assembled as
shown, provide an internal cavity accessible from the outside thru a gate
opening 10c having a plug 10d for closing off said opening. The mold 10 is shown
held in clamping engagement between two shafts 11 and 12 each provided with a
flanged end fixture 11 and

### Page 6
12' not shown which are respectively secured by welding or fasteners to
~~their~~ said respective mold ~~half~~ halves. The shaft 11 is ~~secured~~
supported in bearing by the journals of  a  a motor and drive unit 13 and shaft
12 is supported by a pillow block 14. The base 14' of pillow block 14 is movably
mounted on a base 16 so that shaft 12 and the mold half 10-a supported thereby
may be moved axially to separate said mold half from the other mold half 10b.
Thus by with = drawing 14, the mold sections may be separated and a shaped
article ~~ Molding ~~ therein may be removed therefrom. If a heat cured,
thermoplastic material is to be slush molded to the shape of the cavity formed
by the assembly of the molds, the entire surface of the cavity wall must be
heated to cure the plastic. While a flame ~~ or heat ~~ may be directed against
the exterior of each mold and the resulting heat conducted therethru to the
cavity as the mold rotates to distribute the liquid plastic ~~ poured into ~~
provided therein, I prefer to provide electrical heating means as an integral
part of each mold half or removably associated therewith, thereby eliminating
THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER WITNESSED & UNDERSTOOD BY:  JB aam DATE

the need to dissipate a lot of heat which is wasted ~~ on ~~ by applying heat
directly to the area to be heated and reducing the time required to heat the
mold. The electrical heating means may comprise in addition to means for
conducting electrical energy to the molds halves as they rotate, one or more
heating elements secured as an integral formation ~~ to ~~ on the interior
surface of the cavity of the mold or in sandwich construction as part of the
mold wall. The numerals 17 ~~ 18 and 19 ~~ refers to conducting leads as part of
a circuit containing the electrical ~~ heating ~~ resistence heating elements
associated with the mold half 10b. Said leads or wires 17 ~~ 18 and 19 ~~ extend
from respective points on the mold half where they connect to said mold heating
element/not shown as a wire 19 shown along the shaft 11 to a respective
commutator ring 20 ~~ and 21 at least one of ~~ which are is insulated from said
shaft. An electrical sliding contactor or brushes 21 ~~ 22 and 23 ~~ ride on the
rings 20 ~~ and 21 ~~ for conducting. THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER WITNESSED &

electrical energy from a power supply 24 there thru to the resistance heating
elements as the shaft 11 rotates. One of the rings may be eliminated by merely
grounding the shaft 11 and connecting said ground to the ground of said power
supply. a similar construction is also provided for the mold half 10a and shaft
12 as shown. ST S. ~~ Patent drawings? ~~

~~ Mold Constructions ~~ Figs. 2 and 3 are views showing further details of
modified apparatus in the realm of that shown in Fig. 1 wherein the mild
compresses an assembly 30 ~~ of ~~ of semi-spherical half mold sections 31 and
31 having ~~ a ~~ relatively thin plate-like walls which may be utilized for the
manufacture of large balls and the like. The mold of course, may have any shape
which permits the application of the constructional features to be described. ~~
A ~~ A single piece or unit mold which does not split as shown may also be
provided which conforms to the general construction illustrated whereupon the
soft plastic shell molded therein would be pulled or stripped from said cavity
thru an opening therein. The confidential Matter Witnessed & Understood by JB

A flange circumscribes each mold-half and is adapted to mate with a similar
flange projecting from the rim of the other mold-half. A seal in the form of a
metallic or silicone o-ring ~~ circum ~~ seats in a groove in ~~ one of ~~ the
~~ fla ~~ mating surface of one of the flanges and prevents leakage of liquid
plastic from the mold while said mold ~~ it ~~ is rotating and assembled. The
mold-half section 31' is secured by means of a flange 19 to a shaft 11'
extending from an electric gear-motor unit 13 and is rotatable therewith. a pin
43 secured to and projecting from the flange 30a of mold half 31 engages in an
aligned hole in the flange 30b of the other mold-half section 31' so that the
assembled mold-half will rotate together without slippage. The shells ~~ 30 ~~
31 and 31' are each provided with flat faced portions 33 of increased
crossection in the area of the axis of rotation as shown to provide a simple
mount for the end flanges of the respective shafts and a

A resistance heating element 35 is shown secured to and extending in essentially
a symmetrical pattern about the exterior surface 31-S of the of the mold shell.
Any ~~ suitable ~~ type of suitable electrical resistance heating element may be
employed provided that it heats the interior surface of the mold to the desired
temperature in ~~ at ~~ the desired time. Most slush molding vinyl compounds
require mold curing temperatures in the range of 550 to 750 degrees Farenheit. A
preferred type of heating element is Nicrome wire wrapped in ~~ asp ~~ asbestos
tape or suspended in a compressed mass of an absbestos composition. Such
elements come in ribbon-like ~~ shapes which may be secured to the exterior
surface of the mold in most any zig-zag or  reversing pattern such as the
petal-like pattern illustrated. The resistance wire element ~~ or tape
comprising 35 may be secured ~~ to ~~ to the exterior 31S of the mold-shell with
small self-tapping stainless steel screws or with ~~ at ~~ a high temperature ~~
to ~~ bonding agent such as asbestos cement or ~~ Pyroceram cement. The numerals
18 and 18' refer to electrical connectors such as female plug recepticals

to each end of the conductor of the resistance element 35 and secured to their
respective mold sections, to which a wire 19 is connectable which extends ing ~~
along the ~~ shaft to a commutator ring 21 ~~ for electrical energy conduction
to said element while the mold is rotating. The plugs 18 and 18' permit the mold
or mold halves to be disassembled and replaced with others without having to
sever the wires. In the apparatus of Figs. 2 and 3 one end of each resistance
element is assumed to be grounded on the respective moldhalf which in turn is
grounded thru the shaft and motor or pillow block, thus completing a circuit
with a power supply 24 thru the brushes 21 or 21' riding on respective rings 20
and 20' which are insulatedly mounted on their respective shafts. ~~ 11 and 12.
~~ The numeral 11c refers to a sliding coupling joining the two shaft sections
11' and 11" so that ~~ an ~~ a longitudinal adjustment may be made in the
position of the end of the shaft which connects to the mold section 33. Thus if
it is desired to replace one mold with another which is of a different shape

which is preferably splined and tightening one or more set-screws 11s provided
in threaded holes in 11-c against 11" to prevent axial movent of said shaft.

Make 30 a heating shell for mold Further feature Since it may be desirable to
change the attitude of the axis of rotation of the mold as it rotates, in order
to distribute the liquid plastic more evenly about the surface of the mold, a
means is provided in and shown in Fig. 3 for effecting said change in attitude.
The mounts 16 and 16' for the mo drive unit 13 and bearing as well as lineal
actuator for shaft 12 (not shown) are secured to a frame or platform 15. A shaft
37 is secured to 15 by means of brackets or pillow blocks 38 which is pivotable
on a pair of bearing blocks one of which 36 is shown secured to the introduce

shaft 42 pivotally attached via an end fitting to a fixture 40 with a slotted
hole 40' therein. Thus when shaft 42 is urged by the lineal motor

TO BE CONTINUED TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN On this date, April 21st, 1958 I visited
the plant of Kohner Brothers, 155 Wooster Street N.Y.C. to discuss my delayed
action movement toys drawings of which I had mailed them on April 10-1958. They
claimed that they desire to produce and market one or more of the toy ideas I
submitted. I mentioned when they inquired about rights to all the designs for my
delayed action toys, that S.S. Adams of Asbury Park, N.J. is considering a
delayed action noisemaking toy employing a bellows, bell, or JL 4/21/58

### Page 12
percussion cap and informed them that if Adams takes these items, they would not
be part of the deal. They appeared to be interested in producing my baseball
pitcher and possibly in the rocket launcher hand game and the Jack in the Box
mailed on April 10. 1958. I left a model of the baseball pitcher catapult
employing a suction cup and a toy jumping frog. They will discuss this matter
with a patent attorney to see that a patent of a Mr. Kelly does not come in the
realm of my toys. They may approach Al Zalkind for an opinion. Jerome H Lemelson
April 21-58 J Berliner 4/21/58 April 21 - 1958 S In Fig. 4 is shown
constructional details of molding apparatus applicable to the apparatus of Figs.
1 to 3 or the like. A two-piece mold ~~ 100 ~~ is shown having a cup-like body
100 made of metal, ceramic or other suitable material with an opening at the AAM

top which may be closed off ~~ by means ~~ confining the interior volume 103 by
means of a lid or top 104 which is pivotally mounted on a hinge 108 secured to
the ~~ a rear or ~~ side-wall 101' of the lower container. ~~ 100 ~~ Shafts 11
and 12 are shown secured to respective sides 101 and 101' of the container 100
for the rotation or rocking movement thereof as described. Alan A. Meyerhoff
4/22/58 The top 104 is shaped with a downwardly projecting plug portion 104'
adapted to project into the open end thereof for effecting a seal which may be
enhanced by means of an O-ring 109 seated in a groove therein and circumscribing
the upper rim of the mold body 200. The numeral 110 refers to a handle for
lifting the top to remove the molding therefrom and a conventional latch (not
shown) or locking means may be provided to hold the top 104 in place while the
mold is being rocked or rotated. The crossectional view shows the heating
element, which is an electrical resistance element such as a layer of metal
which is embedded in an

### Page 13
insulating material, extending as a flat strip 111 in one or more circuits
around the interior of the container. The

### Page 14
resistance heating element 111 may comprise a rolled or sprayed on strip of
aluminum, ~~ or ~~ copper or other metal or alloy such as Nichrome and is shown
in Figs. 5 and 6 as being applied to a first insulating layer 112 which may
comprise a glass or ceramic material such as a porcelain glaze material,
glass-ceramic or the like applied in an integral bond to the entire interior
surface of 100 including the upper surface of the rim of said mold. The metallic
resistance element 111 may be provided in the zig-zag or looped pattern shown
which extends across the inside surface of the bottom 102 of the mold and up the
walls thereof which are not shown ~~ to ~~ in ~~ at ~~ one ~~ one ~~ or more ~~
closed ~~ continuous circuits which terminate near the outer edge of the ~~ rim
o ~~ upper surface 101" of the rim of the mold for connecting electrical leads
thereto which extend as shown in Fig. 4 along the outer surface of the mold and
along the adjacent shaft to a contactor ring (not shown) in accordance with the
teaching of Figs. 1 to 3. After the ceramic or porcelain layer 112 has been
applied ~~ to ~~ on, and integrally bonded to the surface of the cavity in the
mold section 100, the element 111 INSERT NOTE A ON P. 23 ~~ NOTE A SEE PAGE 23

may be applied thereto as a formed strip of metal with a high temperature cement
such as Corning glass works Pyroceram cement which may be temperature cured for
a period of an hour or so by passing electrical energy thru said resestence
element 111 for the necessary period of time. Pyroceram band Cement, No. 95,
applied to the near surface of a strip of metal in the looped shape shown for
111 will fire at between 400 to 450°C and if the temperature is maintained by
means of generating heat in said strip 111 by passing current therethru an
excellent bond will be attained A groove, the contour of the illustrated heating
element may be provided in the interior & surface of 100 so that said heating
element will not project beyond the plane of the surface and said surface will
be smooth. A second ~~ technique ~~ method of providing the electrical
resistence element 111 is to sand blast the surface on which it is to be bonded
so as to roughen it, and apply said element as a layer of metal sprayed thereon
from a molten state thru a mask having a cutout to the contour shown. The
notation 104.c in Fig. 4 refers to a cavity or indentation in the undersurface
of the lid 104 which is provided to permit an electrical

### Page 15

connector 114 such as a ~~ lug ~~ lug at the end of wire 19' to be secured to an
end of the resistence element 111 ~~ to be secured to said ~~ for conducting
electrical energy thereto. The cut-out or cavity 104-C ~~ ~~ in 104 will not be
necessitated if the element ~~ 103 ~~ 111 is extended beyond the surface of 104
which engages surface 101' or if the resistence element is brought over the edge
of the rim to the exterior surface of 100 or into a cavity provided in ~~ 10
surface 101' and extending to the outer edge thereof. Two methods of
electrically connecting wire 19' to the element 111 are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.
In Fig. 4, the lid 104 is notched at 104-d near an edge thereof exposing a
portion of the surface of the layer 100-S containing the conducting element 111.
The lug or connector 104-c may ~~ The end of wire 19' may be welded or soldered
to a ~~ surface of 111 which is exposed thru the layer 100S. In Fig. 5 the layer
100S comprises a first coating 112 of ceramic or glass material such as
porcelain or Pyroceram fused onto the interior surface of 100 to which the
element is bonded over which in an area either just covering 111 or as a general
coating on the interior of cavity surface 103 is applied a second coating 113

fused by heat thereon. (e) A preferred construction includes the application of
said second coating 113 by spraying or ~~ by means of spraying, casting or other
means such that, after it is applied and covers the entire inside surface of the
cavity 103 including the fused-on ~~ strip ~~ conducting heating element 111,
said surface is smooth and free of irregularities such as projecting ridges
which may be caused for example by the strip element 111. This may be
accomplished by securing strip 111 in a recess of similar contour and provided
in the layer 112 or in the interior surface 100-S of the mold 100 as shown in
Fig.

Details of the method of securing the end of wire 19' to the conducting strip
portion 111-a which extends along the surface 101" are shown in Fig. 5' which
shows an electrical stand-off pin 114-a having a flanged lower end 104-p welded
or soldered to an exposed portion 111'-a of 111a, the exposure . of the upper
surface thereof being provided by removing part of the overlayer 113 therefrom

114.b is secured to 114.a by conventional means. The upper end of 114.a is
threaded and two nuts 114.c and 114.d hold 114.b thereon. The notation ~~ 19's
~~ 19.S of Fig. 5 refers to a hold-down fastener for securing  19' against the
outer surface of mold 100 to prevent its motion when the latter is rotated. In
Fig. 6 the conducting element 111 is bonded to the inside surface of a sheet of
~~ material 115 which comprises a sheet of metal 115a ~~ having ~~ its outer
surface adapted for surface engagement with the interior surface of the mold 100
and its inside surface coated with a ceramic such as porcelain or a glass
ceramic such a as Pyroceram in which is embedded or secured said element ~~ 100
~~ 111 ~~ by the ~~ in sandwhiche assembly by  on the one of the methods
described for Figs. 4 and 5. ~~ In other wo ~~ The heating element 111 is thus
secured in a ~~ thin sheet ~~ layer of insulating material bonded to a sheet of
metal which is fastened or welded to the wall 100. The cup-like or otherwise
formed from sheet metal or may be formed to any desired thin shell shape,
example of aluminum by casting, or of copper

by electroplating in a base. After its formation, the interior surface is coated
with a ceramic, electrical insulating material as described which as thereon as
described with heat and the heating element 111 is applied by spraying plating
or as a thin strip of metal after which the entire interior surface is again
coated with a ceramic material which is fused by heat. So as not to change the
interior contour of 115, it may also be formed by casting electroplating ~~ or
~~ or other means and the exterior surface thereof coated with a ceramic
insulating material to which element 111 is applied and covered with a further
coating of ceramic material. The ~~ shell ~~ shell 111-S' of Fig 6. would have
its array of materials reversed in the order shown with the interior ~~ surface
~~ therefore being ~~ that ~~ the metal wall section 115: The connecting of Fig.
6 includes a 114-e shaped in the form of an angle, the upper end of which is

and the lower end of which

### Page 18
is secured to the side-wall of 100 by means of a ~~ faslener ~~ fastener 114f
which screws into an insulated insert held in a hole in 100. The lower end of
114-e has an insulated coating on its under-surface to insulate it from the
surface of 100 or is held thereoff by means of 114f. Figs. 7 and 8 show details
of further variations in the construction of heated molds applicable to this
invention. A slush-mold 120 is provided which is secured by means of a flanged
~~ por ~~ upper portion 121 thereof held against a frame or plate 125 preferably
mounting a plurality of said molds. The mold ~~ is ~~ 120 is ~~ secur ~~ shown
secured to ~~ an assembly ~~ a holding fixture 125 and projected into a
container 127 having essentially the same internal contour as the exterior of
the lower portion of 120. A plurality of elongated cavities 128' extend ~~ ing
~~ inward from the main cavity 128 in 127 is provided and in each is secured a
resistence heating element such as a Chromalox Globar. The Globars are spaced to
provide sufficient heat by radiation to the exterior surface of the mold to heat
the interior surface of each the desired degree as the mold ~~ STOP ~~

NOTE A: The inner edge of the upper rim of the main body 100 of the mold is
rounded as shown for two purposes, namely to provide a smooth contour along
which the electrical heating element may extend without experiencing a sharp ~~
bend ~~ inflection or bend and to provide a smoothly contoured surface against
which the lid or top 104 will not sever or damage the insulating material or the
electrical element 111. Similarly, the ~~ co sur ~~ interior surface 100-S of
the cavity 103 is rounded or smoothly contoured as shown. NOTE A p: 16 April 24,
1958 is rotated or oscillated. The flange 121 of the mold 120 is secured to ~~ a
~~ fixture 125 by means of fasteners or rivets and the plate portion of said
fixture is removably secured by means of clamps or fasteners to either the tops
of the ~~ molds 120 furn ~~ heating boxes 129 or the frame or wheel 130 on which
said containers 127 are mounted. After the completion of a molding operation,
the fixture 125 and molds 120 held thereby may be lifted by means of a hook 125a
and a hoist connected thereto, after releasing the means securing 120

easily removed without cooling the ~~ furno g~~ globar container, 127. Upon
removal of one ~~ group of mol ~~ fixture and its molds from the assembly of
heater boxes, a new fixture ~~ and ~~ with associated molds may be lowered to
the position shown in Fig.8 for another cycle. The heater box frame 130 is shown
secured to a shaft 135 which is rotatatable by means of a drive and support, not
shown, and preferably tiltable ~~ a ~~ in the manner taught in Figs. 1 to 3 so
that the ~~ an ~~ axis about which they molds 120 rotate may be changed in

as a liner for the interior wall of mold 102' is a sheet ~~ 13 ~~ of metal 136
having a duct 137 integrally formed in said sheet. The wall of the integrally
formed duct which faces inward is in the plane of the surface of the sheet and
the other wall of the duct protrudes or bulges beyond the other wall of the
sheet 136. In order to accomodate the bulging portion of the duct 137 a groove

Cement such as Pyroceram cement. Flowing a hot fluid such as molten metal such
as lead, zinc or aluminum, heated hydraulic fluid, or a salt bath solution thru
the ducting 137 may be used to cure the cement as well as to ~~ transfer ~~ heat
the wall of the liner 137 to the desired temperature. After heating by such
means and at the end of a heating cycle, the hot liquid still in 137 may be
purged therefrom by means of an inert gas under pressure. If a high temperature

absorbent material such as ~~flexible ~~ foamed plaster in a flexible condition.
The patch 18 may be secured to 12 with and adhesive or, if made of a porous
foamed plastic such as flexible vinyl foam may electronically sealed to 12. The
end portions of 12 are coated with and adhesive of the pressure sensitive
variety and pealable ~~ and ~~ covered strips 18 may be employed to cover said
adhesive prior to its use in accordance with conventional practice. A flanged
U-shaped cover 20 is secured to strip 12 in alignment with the wad 18 on the
opposite surface 13 of 12 and may be used to serve several purposes. The cover
20 may consist of a top portion 22 having side walls 24 and 24' at each end
thereof which extend to respective flange portions 26 and 26' which are secured
to the upper surface 13 of 12. The ~~ top portion ~~ cover 20 is preferably made

preferably made of a material such as rigid vinyl cellulose acetate, polystyrene
or the like which has been molded or vacuum formed to the desired U or cup
shape. If both 20 and 12 are made of polyvinyl chloride or any plastic which is
electronically heat sealable, the flanges 26 and 26' may be electronically
welded to the flexible base sheet 12 along welding lines such as 27 shown
extending along the length of said flanges which is essentally the width of the
strip 12. Otherwise, the flanges 26 and 26' may be secured to the upper surface
of 12 with and adhesive or heat sealed along lines 27 therets by means of heated

Sept. 4, 1958 Record of Conception of Inventions The following variations of the
Hula-Hoops which are sweeping the country are conceived: Ball dispensing hoops:
It is conceived to use the interior of the tubing comprising the hoop as a
storage volume for a plurality of small balls such as marbles, candy or ball gum
and to provide means for easily dispensing these balls thru an opening in the
wall of the hoop. This would serve several purposes (a) Multiple functions(1) If
the hoop is produced of transparent plastic, the balls may be seen from the
exterior as they roll around when the hoop is whirled thereby increasing the
visual attractiveness (2) means for storing and dispensing marbles and candy (3)
when filled will balls or marbles the hoop will be more difficult to twirl and
maintain on the body or arm than when empty The degree of skill required may
thus be varied by adding or removing marbles.

19(N+1), 19(N+2) etc each responsive to and adapted to become energized when a

Some interesting variations in this system are noted as follows:

In Fig 2 means are provided for remotely (~~ from the monitor~~ connecting solar
battery output 10b to the power input 10b' of a television camera 22 which
thereafter may be used for monitoring the environment around said detection unit

signal of a specific characteristic from the monitor station so that the solar
battery 10 will not be chained of its energy except when it is 2/19/54 m/37

desired to operate the television camera 22 for a short period of time to
monitor the environment at station N. For example, if the detector 12 indicates
an abnormal or predetermined condition in the environment at station N and coded
relay 19N ~~ heed ~~ at the monitor station ~~ 1 ~~ 16 becomes energized, the
operator at the monitor station may decide to visually monitor the environment
of the detection station 9N. He may then energize a ~~ 1 ~~ code generator 36N
by means of a switch 35. The output of the code generator 36N is connected to a
short wave transmitter 38 which transmits signals to ~~ all ~~ receivers located
at each of the detection stations. The receiver 26 of detection station 9N
receives the pulse, code from 38, and passes it to the input of a coded relay

The ~~ transmitter 14 ~~ signal transmission means of the detection station 9-N
and of all detection stations in the system supplied power by means of a solar
battery as preferably operated at two power levels; one to transmit the pulse

expenditure as compared to that required for the transmission of the video
signal generated by camera 22. Since it is

The signal transmitter 14 is preferably disconnected from the battery

### Page 52
is deenergized and/or the operator of the monitor station has not actuated his
control means therefor, so that the battery 10 will not be unessessarily
drained. A gate 23 is therefor provided between the output 10c of the battery 10
and the power input to the signal transmitter 14T for effecting said connection
only where necessary to transmit signals from the detection station. The switch
23 may be provided in a number of different forms which are adapted to complete
a circuit between 10 and 14T when the detector relay 12 is energized and/or when
the coded relay 28 is energized. The switch 23 may be a normallyopen,
slow-to-close after opening switch adapted to remain closed for a sufficient
period of time after its input is energized by a pulse signal from coded relay
28 to permit the transmission of at least one video picture signal from the
camera 22 which may be a conventional or slow scanning device. The continuous
transmission of the pulse code from code generator 36N may thus be used to
maintain 23 closed for desired periods of time

for prolonged transmission of video signals during monitoring. In addition to
the connection of the signal output of the coded relay to the switching input of
23, the output of detector 12 is also connected to said switching input so that
if either become energized, 23 will close. The receiver 26 and coded relay 28
will necessarily be connected to a source of electrical energy at all times.
They may either receive power from 10 or from their own solar batteries. If 26
and 28 ~~and ~~are made of semi-conductor switching and amplifying means, the
power drain thereof will be minimized. A further modification to the apparatus
at the detection unit is ~~ sow ~~shown in Fig. 1. The transmitter~~ por ~~ part
of 14 is preferably normally off, so as not to drain the battery. It is
connectable to the battery 10 by means of a normally open switch 13 which is
closed only when a signal is present on its ~~ in~~switching input from the
detector 12 which is generated only when the transducer thereof is energized. If

Subject: Target Games and toys using zipperless closure material Description: My
wife recently purchase a belt which utilizes a zipperless closure material which
consists of two materials one of which consists of a plurality of tiny plastic
filament hooks arranged to provide a hooking surface and a second material
having plurality of plastic filament loops in a surface which, when brought
against the hooking surface, is snared by the hooks and holds until stripped
away. These materials are being used ~~ fr ~~ to replace zippers on jackets,
etc. I conceive of using these materials in a unique dart game with one of the
materials being provided on the nose of a dart, puck, horseshoe, arrow, toy
bomb, tip of a sword or the like and the other on the surface of a target. When
the missile sword strikes the target the hooking material will engage the target
material and will hold the missile thereon or the sword may be used to move or
remove the other material from the target. A ball or sphere may also be covered
with this material and be thrown, rolled, or shot at a target form a gun or blow
pipe struck by a bat, golf club,  at a target containing the material adapted to
hook therewith Jereome Lemelson 2/14/59 Jan 14, 1959 MBF

January 21, 1959 I visited Leon Kaye, Kaye Plastics today and showed him models
of Swing-A-Ring and Glide Rocket toys I have developed. While there, Kaye showed
me a sample of a plastic part (rabbit face) he had molded, which when held
against a fluorescent light, glowed quite brightly when the light was turned
off. He said the plastic contained phosphoresent pigments. I conceived, while
present at Kaye's plant several novelty ideas including a molded skull lapel
novelty, lapel nameplates and buttons and disclosed these to him. He, however,
refused to give me samples of the material when I told him I wanted to show them
to my mold makers, (Sands and Warmbrand) who have expressed interest in the past
in making a mold for me on a royalty basis. He said that he would give me a
sample in a couple of weeks. Just before the item is introduced I have conceived
of many novel applications of this material in displays, novelties and toys
which JHL Jan 21, 1959

I expect to make the subject of pending patent application. Some of these are:
1. Articles made of flexible plastic sheeting which has been made of plastic
mixed with phosphorescent or luminescent plastic thruout. (a)Display device:
flexible "glo-sheet" used as a closed loop belt part of which is exposed to an
observer thru an opening in the display housing. The belt is driven in a closed
loop path around pulleys by a servo-motor and is exposed intermittently to light
within the housing. The light exposing the sheet-belt is presented in a pattern
so that ~~ th ~~ when the sheet is driven past the opening in the housing, the
observer will view the glowing pattern. The speed of the belt or the time
between separate exposures may be determined by the decay characteristics of the
phosphorescent material in the plastic and the effect desired. If the pattern is
always the same, such as letters and words of a message created on the belt by
stopping it in front of a mask behind which JHL Jan 21, 1959 2/14/59 MBF

June 20 - 1959 Conception Of Invention Combined circular saw blade and sander
For many mfg operations particularly those involved in cutting small wood parts,
the cut is generally rough and leaves sharp or jagged edges. It is conceived to
perform two operations with a saw blade, that of cutting plus that of finishing
during the same path. Fig 1 The blade 10 is provided with teeth 14 shaped from
the ~~ sh ~~ circle shee 12. Inward of the teeth ~~ are ~~ is provided an
abrasive surface which may be:

(a) formed from the material of 12 (b) comprise abrasive particles bonded to 12

mailed flat (die cut.) He suggested I work up models. (b) Compressed sponge- Max
asked me to develop a process for making sponge(foamed cellulose acetate,
urethane or vinyl) into a sheet flatter than normal size. I suggested use of a
paste or water soluble plastic (such as polyvinyl alcohol) impregnating normal
sponge and allowed to harden or dry while sponge is in compressed state. He
asked me to experiment on this. I also suggested that this be done with molded
figures of foamed plastic (flexible) which will "pop-up" to normal state in

brush in polishing my shoes. J Lemelson Dec 4. 59 December 5,1959 Have conceived
of the following simplified design for a plastic flash light requiring a minimum
number of parts which I will disclose to Max Silverman next week for proposal to
Doerty, Cliff Sears & Senseld for ~~ use ~~ giveaway with Viatlis (see next
page) The simplified ~~ dallo ~~ flash light 10 consist of only 3 molded plastic
parts, a cylindrical (or other shaped) battery holder 12, a head 16 and a
transparent plastic lens. 23. J.B. Gilstein 12/20/59

The end of 12 is threaded at 13 to receive the threaded end of 19 of lamp head
16.

Fig. 1 Transparent, flexible plastic such as plasticized vinyl

The lines in red refer to a length of metal rod, preferably music wire which
contacts the bottom of battery #2, runs along the wall of 12 and is bent into a
V-shape at the other end where it contacts the side wall of the light bulb stem
thru an opening 12/ in 20' when 20 is rotated at the proper angle pages 124
through 139 Read & understood by me on this 5th day of Dec. 1959 Jerome M.

Record of Conception of Invention Oct 29-1958 Automatic Information Storage and
Reproduction System Reference is made to the commercially available COPYFLO
continuous printer manufactured by Haloid Xerox, Inc Rochester 3, N.Y. It is
conceived to utilize a machine such as the COPYFLO 24 on the like with certain
patentable modifications in the control thereof as a major component in an
automatic storage and printing system applicable to such functions as: (a) The
system utilized by the U.S. Patent Office for the filing of copies of patents
and the retrieval of said copies for individuals requesting them. Presently a
certain number of each copy is printed and stored. Copies are hand picked by one
or more of about two dozen office workers, collected and placed in envelopes

### Page 4
which are mailed When copies run out of a particular patent, a new batch must be
printed My system would print copies only when needed, ~~ colla ~~ automatically
collate, staple or bind, collect and place them in envelopes as well as address
the envelopes and record the transaction. It is possible that the above
functions may be performed by a single operator. (b) Any system (Government or
private) where a considerable amount of information is stored and individual
pages, or groups of pages are frequently requested such as a library of
technical information, a government agency ~~ requesting ~~ from which
subscribers request bulletins, etc. Reference is made to the Schematic diagram
of the Copyflow 24 Continuous Printer on the page. The current invention
consists of modifications to the input thereto as well as the

conveying and handling of prints made in said apparatus Start The current
invention is illustrated broadly in the schematic - block diagram of Fig. 1 (on
page 7.) A single operator is required to effect the multiple functions of
selecting pictorial information to be reproduced as a plurality of pages,
collated,

First describe what happens, (operator continuously selects cards but selection
time for each card varies)

### Page 5
stapled or bound, enveloped and addressed. A plurality of image frames of the
information to be reproduced are provided in a storage system 20 which includes
means, controlled by a selector inpat for selectively drawing therefrom selected
of said frames. The frames are preferably provided as microfilmed images mounted
on punch cards ~~ for ~~ containing cutouts for identifying, selecting and
storing said cards. In a preferred form of the invention, each card is further
modified with a magnetic recording strip portion or the like for temporarily
storing thereon coded information adapted to effect one or more functions to be
described. The input for effecting the selection of predetermined cards from
system 20 may be derived by conventional selection means with modifications
thereto for recording further information on said magnetic recording area of
each card. Since the time required for the actual derivation of a particular
card or cards from the system will be

Fig. 1 (Schematic of System) (1) collate but envelope by hand (2) auto. address
(3) Rather than envelope, wrap auto. (4) Stor. Unit 24 may feed to 32 thereby
eliminating need to mag. record or cards.

### Page 6
a variable, and it is not desirable to await the selection of one card before
manually effecting the selection of the next, an intermediate input storage
system 24 is provided for storing signals derived from the manual selector 22
and for reading out at least part of each selection signals group to be
magnetically recorded on the respective card for later use. The notation 26
refers to a card reading and recording device adapted to read the code on ~~ the
~~ each selected card which identifies it card and to transmit said code as a
feed-back signal to the intermediate storage and control system 24 whereafter
signals recorded therein relative to said card are transmitted to a recording
head 28 and recorded on the magnetic recording area of the card. The notation 27
refers to the reading transducers(s) for the cutouts or other means for ~~ in ~~
identifying the card, the output of which is the input to the intermediate
storage and control system and so is adapted to

effect the read-out of the code ~~ to ~~ stored therein which pertains to the
particular card in the recording section of 26 The numeral 29 refers to a
conveyor which is a continuation of the means for conveying the selected cards
from 20 thru the unit 26 and is adapted for carrying said cards to a card feeder
30 for which the automatic printing machine 34 which may comprise, in general,
apparatus such as the Copyflo 24 manufactured by Haloid Xerox, Inc. of
Rochester, New York. From the card feeder ^30 the cards are individually fed
thru an optical system whereupon an image of each is projected onto a selenium
plated drum and transferred as a print to a sheet of paper 33 provided from a
roll as a belt which passes out of the machine 34 and is cut into individual
lengths or pages by means of automatic cutting apparatus 37. After each card is
optically scanned, it is automatically fed into a card receiver and scanner 32
the operation of which is synchronized

### Page 7
{{page}} to the movement of the belt 33 of moving print. The unit 32 effects the
scanning of the signals temporarily recorded on the magnetic recording area of
the card and transmits these as a plurality of control signals to apparatus for
automatically collating, stapling or binding plural pages of the matter printed
in 34 and enveloping an order for one or more of said sheets or pamphlets. The
unit 38 is an automatic collating machine and 39 is an automatic stapling or
binding device. The unit 40 effects the en  placement of one or more sheets,
{{strikethrough}} or {{/strikethrough}} pamphets, or multiple stapled copies of
reproduction, from the printer, 34. A fourth unit 41 may be provided to print
the address of the recipient or customer on the envelope. Units 38 to 41 are
responsive to control signals reproduced from the cards as they pass thru the
reader 32. The notations 32'a, 32'b, 32'c and 32'd refer to delay means in the
{{/page}}

inputs to 38 to 41 strikethrough}} {{?}} {{/strikethrough}} and/or relay storage
means adapted for assuring that the functions controlled by the temporary
recordings on the cards occur at the proper instant. It is noted that if the
intermediate storage and control system 24 is modified and connected directly to
the reader 32, ~~st it will not be necessary to record control signals for
controlling 38 to 41 on each card. The reader and controller 24 may be provided
in one of a number of forms each of which is adapted to receive and store coded
information in the form of a ~~ pulse trains or the like, each of which

feeder 30 in the order they are completed. A compromise control system is shown
on pages 43 and 44. The control consists of a rotary switch 51 consisting of a
pulse operated stepping motor 51-2 adapted to rotate an arm 51-1 one switching
position each time a pulse is fed to the input of the stepping motor.

described is to be used by the Patent Office in storing & reproducing copies of

reproduce the parallel codes recorded on the selection code storage drum 24
which is in constant motion as described. When the code reproduced from the drum
~~ is ~~ 24a is equal to the code appearing on the outputs 78 of the
photomultiplier scanning bank 77, the code matching relay 24d provides a control
signal on its output 24d'. If only a single column of images is provided on 73,
the signal may be used to gate the video picture signal derived by scanning the
image frame present at the scanner camera. In the more elaborate system where
each of the cameras 60-I to 60-N scans a different column, a further control
circuit is provided for the selective ~~ playback ~~ gating of only that signal

### Page 28
The video picture signal derived from scanning the selected image frame is
passed thru an electronic gate which is operated when the selection code
reproduced from drum 24a corresponds with the frame indicating code reproduced
by reading bank 77 and relay 24d becomes energized. The pulse output of 24d is
used to effect two control actions. At is utilized to close a normally open,
mono-stable electronic gate 60 which is slow-to-open and remains closed for a
time period while the drum 24a rotates thru an angle ~~ equal to ~~ in which ~~
at ~~ essentially the ~~ are ~~ elemental strip area thereof, which pertains to
said ~~ a ~~ single ~~ selection ~~ parallel selection code passes ~~ a ~~ me
magnetic reproduction heads 68. The signal (or signals)reproduced by a read head
68 is related to the code which energizes 24d and is of a characteristic such
that it will effect the presetting of a rotary

switch 62 to effect the completion of a circuit ~~ between with the output of
camera 60 which ~~ between the output of that one of the cameras 60- which is
scanning the column of image frames in which the selected frame or frames is
located and is passing into the scanning field of said camera as the rotary
switch 62 is operated. While rotary switch 62 may be an electro-mechanical
stepping switch operated by a solenoid which steps at one portion each time a
pulse is received on the output of 68, it (62) is preferably an electronic
gating device such as a magnetron beam switching tube which has a much higher
switching rate. The signals recorded on the channel of the drum which is swept
by head 68 are thats adapted to ~~ prep ~~ operate rotary switch 62 in a manner
whereby the picture signal(s) gated thru 62 to the transducing means for
reproducing the corresponding optical or usual image or images for

### Page 29
photographic reproduction thereof, are those relating to the codes reproduced
from drum 24a which energize the matching relay 24d and ~~ are ~~ defined by the
signals reproduced by head 68 during the ~~ same ~~ time the elemental band
containing the parallel code passes the heads 24R1 to 24RN. In other words, the
code reproduced by heads 24R- is used to define the row in which the selected
frame appears and the head 68 reproduces the ~~ se ~~ series code or signals
defining the column in which said frame appears. If there are N positions to
rotary switch ~~ 62d ~~ 62 (i.e. N cameras scanning N columns of image frames )
and 62 is a pulse stepped on actuated electronic gate such as a beam switching
tube of N switching positions ), then the number of pulses reproduced by 68
during the interval gate 69 remains closed when passed to the switching control
62' of switch 62, will determine the

switching position of 62. Thus the band arca of 24a on which each parallel
selection code is recorded has also associated therewith one or more signals
which are recorded when the parallel code is recorded which signals may comprise
a series code or pulse train adapted for selectively positioning switch 62 to
pass ~~ there thru ~~ to its output 64 only the signal produced by the camera
scanning the selected image frame on the tape or belt 73. The control 62' for 62
contains an automatic control means such as a semi-conductor timing means for
maintaining the selected switching position, resulting from the action of the
signals passed thru gate 69, for a time interval necessary to pass the picture
signal generated on ~~ at ~~ the output 61- of the camera scanning the selected
image frame, to the output 64 of said switch 62, whereafter said control 62'
opens switch 62 so that no signal passes

to 64. The circuit 64 may connect directly to the input amplifier 65 ~~ of a ~~
for a video image producing device such as a picture storage tube 65 or image
writing tube which may directly convert said signals to a charge pattern or
latent image pattern on a sheet of paper, reference being made to the Videograph
printing equipment now available from the A. B. Dick Company of Chicago, Ill. ~~
Since ~~ If a plurality of tandem signals are made to appear on 64 and the speed
at which the image frames of conveyor 73 are moved and scanned is different than
that at which the printing paper and mechanism of the printing unit 34' is
operated, then an intermediate storage system ~~ 7070 cord is necessary ~~ 70
for the video picture signals is necessary between the output of the camera with
62 and the storage or picture

writing tube 65. Intermediary storage may be effected by means of a closed loop
magnetic tape or drum the servo drive means for which is operated by means of an
automatic controller such as an electronic multi-circuit, recycle timer which is
energized by the signal output of code matching relay 24d to drive the tape in
the proper manner to effect the recording of the video picture signal therein
each time a picture signal is passed to circuit 64. The intermediate storage
system 70 may also contain means therein for sorting the picture signals (i.e.
tape to tape transfer) which appear on 64 in a random or numerical order, into
groups as ordered. For example, if the system is used for patent retrieval, then
any single order for patents may require patents with numbers appearing in

### Page 31
different locations on the storage medium 73. By recording coded information
with each selection code on drum 24a, pertaining to the name and address of the
person placing the order, this information may be used to collate or group ~~
all ~~ signals passed to the intermediary storage 70, into order groups.
Intermediate Storage System & Printout Fig. 61 (p. 61) is a schematic diagram of
the (a possible) intermediate storage system 70 of Fig. 53. Picture signals
(composite with sync pulses) appearing on line 64 are passed to the single input
of a rotary stepping switch 73 and then over one of the multiple outputs 73'
thereof to a picture signal storage means 75 such as a charge storage tube or
continuously rotating magnetic drum adapted to store just one frame sweep
(composite) picture signal. The output 75' of each storage tube 75 is connected
to a respective magnetic recording head 77 adapted to record on a first
elongated closed loop magnetic tape 76 which is driven continuously in a closed
loop path over drums 76a and 76b by a contact speed gear motor drive 76'. Each
storage tube has a pulse actuated input trigger control means 75" which causes
its "read-bead" to read the charge pattern on the face of the tube and provide
the ~~red~~composite video picture signal on output 75' when pick-up head 78 is
energized by a pulse (or lack of pulse) on the tape which is indicative that no

Fig. 61

### Page 32
picture signal is present on that section of tape 76 being swept by record head
77. Switch 73 is stopped each time a picture signal passes therethru by passing
the composite video picture signal thru a vertical sync clipper 71, the clipped
pulse output of which energizes a time delay relay 72 which actuates stepping
motor 74 which steps 73 after the entire composite video picture signal has
passed thru to a respective storage tube 75. The control 75C for each storage
tube is automatic so that each time its trigger input is energized, it will
automatically provide an output picture signal and then become erased. The
notation 75 refers to a magnetic recording means for each tube which records on
76 not only the picture signal but code signal (series binary code) identifying
the picture signal. If the scanning means 60 (Fig. 53) are video cameras or the
like, then the code reproduced by the photomultiplier heads 77 will necessarily
be converted in a shift register to a series binary code and presented on 64
either preceding or following the picture signal associated therewith. The code
may also be an optical part of the frame field scanned (along a strip area above
or below the picture in the so call blanking or back porch region) Whereupon it
will be part of the picture signal and may be derived for selection purposes by
clipping the picture signal in the blanking interval and passing the resulting
series pulse train to a series to parallel shift register the output of which is
connected to code matching relay 87. The next function is to selectively
reproduce and separate and record all picture signals pertaining to image frames
which pertain to respective orders. A plurality of magnetic recorders 81 are
provided for this purpose. The control event

for each of the recorders is illustrated in part in the diagram associated with
recorder-reproducer unit ~~ and ~~ 81-1 and in part in the diagram for 81-3. The
tape 82 of each recorder unit 81 is used both as a control signal recording
medium and as a means ~~ fall ~~ for recording information signals. The control
signal input is illustrated in the diagram for unit 81-1. The operator of the
input selector 22 sets up a parallel binary code on a plurality of output lines
100 by manually ~~ open ~~ closing switches. (ref diagrams pp. 29 and 32). The
parallel code developed on lines 100 is indicative of the order number. It is
converted to a series code in a shift register 101 which code is passed thru a
rotary stepping switch 102 to the recording inputs of one of the records 81. The
series code introduced on the output 101' of 101 after passing thru switch 102
is transmitted over two currents, (1) 103a which is an input to a shift register
106 which converts it to parallel code in multiple output circuits 107 which
record the code in parallel on tape 82 of 81. ~~ 106 ~~ Shift register 106 is
preferably with a plurality of holding relays or slow-to-open after-closing
switches on each of the lines 107 which retain each energized line thereof in a
state of energization for a sufficient period of time to permit the parallel
code to be recorded on the entire length of tape 82 driven

relay 104 which maintains an output signal (gates a power supply) to energizing
a bank of erase heads 108 for erasing all prior signals on the tape 82 including
picture and code signals

before heads 107 record thereon. The output of 104 is also passed to the
energizing input of a multi-current, repeat cycle timer which  of  starts and
stops the servo drive 84 to drive at least the complete length of the tape 82
past the heads. Each recorder 81 is also provided with gating control means for
recording on its tape only those picture signals stored on tape 76 which are
recorded with or identified by the same code existing  and  along the entire
length of tapes 81 (i.e. the order parallel code lines 100 extend also to one

order code reproduced from 76 by heads 80 is the same as that continuously
executing at heads 89 (recorded on the entire length of tape 82, relay 87
becomes energized and provides an output signal which effects several functions.
The output of 87 is passed to the energizing input of a multicircuit, self
recycling timer 87' which sequentially (a) starts drive motor 84 for  tape  the
transport of tape 82, (b) closes a gate 85 in the output of picture signal
reproduction head 79 whereby the selected picture signal is passed to a
recording head 86 riding on tape 82 and recorded thereon (c) energizes an erase
head 79E to erase the picture signal after it has been

reproduced from tape 76, (d) energizing a pulse signal recording head 79R' for
recording a signal adjacent the erased length of the tape 76 used which signal
may be later used to energize one of the heads 78. and (e) energizes the stop
control 84S of drive 84 to stop movement of 82 until the next next selected
picture signal is to be recorded. After all of checkmark the tapes 81 have had
containing selection videos have had all selected picture signals recorded
thereon, the signals on each tape may be reproduced (one tape at a time) and
transduced to image prints or photographic reproductions in the printer 95. The

drwing the prints. The lack of a pulse on the output f 97 indicates that all
picture signals have been reproduced from that type of recorder the reproduction
output of which is co 90L of which is connected 92 thru 91. The lack of output
from 97 may be used to effect the stepping of 91 to the next position so that
picture signals may be reproduced from the next tape in order. The output of 97
is also connected to the reset input 99' of a time delay relay 99 (continued on

Aug. 15 1951 INTRODUCTION This notebook is intended ~~ to ~~ as a record of the
conceived inventions and progress in the development of electrical toys. The
inventor is completing a patent application, as this is written, on electrical
wheeled toys employing some of the basic manufacturing techniques to be
discussed in detail and utilized in the fabrication of the toy inventions to be
described. Many of the inventions to be listed and (or) sketched and described
in detail have already been recorded by individual sheets which have been
witnessed by the inventors brother and, mailed to record the date. In addition,
Mr. Richard Blum of Mock & Blum has also witnessed a number of inventions on
paper of his firm Mr. Alex Friedman and Mr. Levy, know, have known of my basic
vehicle invention since I first discussed it with ~~ them ~~ Richard Blum last
January. Mr. Edward Baggott of Murdock Ave, Queens will be shown my present
patent drawings and some drawings relating to some of the ramifications of this
toy and proposed manufacturing techniques. Jerome Lemelson Aug 15-51 Witnessed

Aug. 15, 1951 Electrical Toys and Games Employing Printed, Stamped or Sprayed
Circuits. About nine months ago the author conceived of the possibility of
applying some of the present circuit application techniques to model toys and
games in combination preferably with electrical insulation materials such as
thermo-setting (plastic) JHL. and general plastic materials, paper, wood, etc.
These techniques involve printing, spraying, painting metals or metallic
materials which are capable of conducting an electric current to the
nonconducting surface of a game or toy. It is conceived that properly developed
manufacturing techniques for applying these conducting strips to toys would
enable their fabrication at a considerably lower cost than an item fabricated ~~
whi ~~with conducting elements such as wires (soldered), rods ~~ st~~. These
techniques could conceivably be applied to such items (to be described in
detail) as: (1) Toy vehicles and tracks (2) Toy vehicle games (utilizing a track
on a playing surface (3) Toy games utilizing circuits to create a variety of
electrically actuated effects. (4) General electrical toys.

August 15, 1951 Since I intend to file my first patent application in about a
week I am attempting to record most of my conceived ideas in this field at this
time Manufacturing Techniques and Devices: (1) Application of conducting element
by contact (printing or rolling). The conducting material may be a metal applied
in the molten state, a current conducting plastic applied as a liquid which
hardens upon cooling or sets after exposure to air, a powdered metal with a
bonding agent, etc. (A) Printing thru a porous plate: (Sintered metal, etc) (i)

Porous Metal, etc. SUB-RESERVOIR FOR MOLTEN METAL, etc CONTACT, FORCE THRU METAL
(PRESSURE) & WITHDRAW Plastic or other INSULATED SURFACE (ii) Use of Porous Drum
or Roller for applying a stripe or other conducting element(s) to a surface.

Aug. 15-1951 TEMPLATE AND SPRAYER: (AUTOMATIC) (A) WORK MOVES ACROSS SPRAYER For
~~ pain ~~ applying stripes of conducting material to such items as toy tracks,
roadbed, etc., the technique may suffice to have the work secured to a bed which
rides in front of a ~~ metal ~~ spray gun for metals, current conducting
plastics etc. while the latter applys the coating as a strip or circuit.

according to the shape of a template Applying A STRIP of ~~ THIN ~~ SHEET METAL
TO MOLTEN PLASTIC. (A) Apply during molding operation (REQUIRES SPECIAL MOLD
WITH NECESSITY OF SETTING up for each run unless automatic feeding of sheet
(stamped) is including. (B) Apply by heating thermosetting plastic in area where
sheet is to be applied (viz - by appling sheet hot) If, for example, a thin

Aug 15-1951 strip is ~~ to bonded ~~ applied to a plastic which is in a
semi-molten state, it will be bonded to the latter when it solidifies. One
technique of applying a thin strip of metal is as follows:

Another fabricating technique would be to pore a thin layer of the metal into a
cavity or indentation in the surface of the plastic and allow it to solidify. In
this technique, the metal could be made to flow a slit in the dispenser as the
work moves with respect to the latter. These techniques will be further
investigated and one or more may be worked out ~~ with ~~ possibly with Ed
Baggott. One more technique is to roll a current conducting material on a drum
or plate (transfer it to) and then transfer it to the insulating (plastic)
material. Toys and Games

may be fabricated of plastics, paper, or other insulating material and ~~ any of
~~ circuits applied utilizing one or more of the discussed techniques,
presenting a cheap electrical toy which may by mass produced with a minimum of
hand labor for wiring, assembly, etc. Some of the following listed items which
have been conceived by the author have been previously recorded and witnessed.
They are presented here again for the benefit of classification and to be
recorded formally in a witnessed notebook in the event of future litigation.
Toys: 1. Toy vehicles, driving motor and simple plastic track. (Patent will be
applied for) 2. Toy train or vehicle and multiple circuits (also to be included
in patent): having a series of electrically operated devices 3. Toy vehicle with
lateral movement possible by utilizing a remotely actuated solenoid to turn
vehicle wheels. (recorded) 4. Toy model airplane - a vehicle having a driving
motor, and having a moveable arm secured there to, a model airplane Aug. 15,
1951 secured to said arm, said arm being capable of traversing a fixed path as
the vehicle moves or said arm being controlled by a motor within said ~~ vec ~~
vehicle which in turn is controlled remotely, giving the effect of the airplane
taking off, flying, and landing as the vehicle moves across the surface tracks.
5. A toy vehicle (automobile) having such remotely controlled accessories as (a)
toy lights turned on and off remotely, (b) brakes applied remotely (c) horn
remotely controlled (d) windshield wiper remoted turned on and off (e) doors
opened remotely (f) tail lights, (g) turns controlled remotely, etc. These may
be done in accordance with the multiple circuits to be described in my pending
patent or by using current pulses of different voltage or amperage ranges to
operate each device. (6) A toy vehicle or object driven by a vibrating type
motor mounted within said vehicle. The motor would transmit forced pulsations in
one direction to move the vehicle or would vibrate elements extending from the
base of the vehicle in one direction to exert a series of pulses on said element
and drive Witnessed by: Howard Lemelson Aug 15, 1951 Witnessed D Julius Lemelson

vibrated by a small motor to cause a column of gas ~~ ente ~~ in a tube
extending from the piston or diaphragm to vibrate and propell the vehicle. (8)
Jumping Toy - a solenoid in the base of the toy acting against the track to
cause the toy to jump with respect to the surface. GAMES AND VEHICLE - SURFACE
TOYS. (1) Toy Racing Games - Recorded Techniques in circuitry design (a)
Crossing two or more surface elements without shorting. (1) Apply an insulating
~~ lo ~~ coating to one element in the neighborhood of coating and then cross ~~
of ~~ over with the other element. (2) Stop one element short on each side of
the other and bring it around underneath by utilizing a ~~ clip or other ~~
Y-shaped conductor element. viz.

Aug 15 - 1951 (b) Connecting to elements ~~ with ~~ design element strip with a
projecting section which is secured to the power lead viz. This is done so that
there will not be a projection above the surface of the strip on the latter (2)
Toy Vehicle Board - Traffic Control game. The board consists of a shaped surface
made of an insulating material such as a plastic which is placed a series of
crossing vehicle guiding lanes with means for conducting electrical energy to
drive motors in the vehicle. Control may be had (left, right turning, reversing
etc) by utilizing separate circuits consisting in part of thin, narrow current
conducting strips on the surface of the road bed each contacted by a separate
brush or wheel to conduct the current in the circuit associated with that strip
to the electrical device in the vehicle, in this case a solenoid ~~wih ~~ which
is linked to the wheel turning mechanism or, and perhaps a little more difficult
an arrangement, is one in which the solenoid is actuated by a voltage pulse,

the main circuit which supplies current to the vehicle, a ~~ plu ~~ pulse which
is of a higher voltage than the line voltage, which actuates the solenoid
momentarily and turns the wheels of the vehicle. Another technique for
controlling the path of the vehicle across the board, would be to supply ~~ ele
~~ projecting elements which could be applied to the board in advance of the
actual ~~ ly ~~ run which would govern the course of the vehicle by deflecting
it or otherwise turning it. Still another technique for the vehicle ~~ board ~~
path control would involve the ~~ rul ~~ utilization of a special board having
elements which may be remotely caused to project from the surface of the board
~~ or ~~ to affect the path of the vehicle or otherwise be controlled to affect
the vehicle path (to be worked out) Toy Games: Toss Games(A) Several games have
been conceived utilizing circuits which may

Aug 15 1951 be cheaply applied to a non-conducting surface. If, for example, a
game is made whereby the object is to toss a current conducting element such as
a coin on a surface to cause a bell to ring or a light to light up (i.e. short a
circuit with a coin) the following techniques may be utilized in laying out the
surface with the conducting elements. (i.e. game layout)

Strips 1 and 2 form a circuit with a power supply (battery) P and bell or buzzer
(B) which is not complete until a coin or current conductor (3) shorts the
circuit by resting across the circuit ~~ s ~~ elements (1) & (2) where they are
close together. So as not to confuse the game, the elements (1) & (2) may be
covered with an opaque paint in the areas where the targets (contacting areas)
are not located and a target may be painted around said contacting area.

This is a variation in the above with the darkened sections representing
conducting layers on the surface of the playing board. J Lemelson Aug 15-51

PIN BALL GAMES: If a large current conducting ball is employed, it may be used
to short (or close) a current by rolling over and simultaneously contacting two
conducting surface elements which are form in a common circuit and are closely
shaped together, the ball acting to slow the circuit temporarily, viz:

Game Employing a variable Rheostat and Electrically Operated Toy Vehicle or
Figures This is a game of chance whereby a constant voltage power supply ~~ such
~~ is utilized, ~~ and ~~ in series with a variable resistor which may be varied
by

Aug. 15, 1951 spinning to give a variable voltage to vehicles on the playing
board, thereby causing d.c. motors in vehicles traveling over said board to run
at ~~ a ~~ different speeds and drive said vehicle at different speeds. In other
words, a series of vehicle each ~~ identicle~~ having an identical power rated
motor are raced about a track each being supplied with current on a different
circuit. A variable ~~ potentiometer~~ (rheostat is placed in each circuit and
the voltage of that circuit is varied by chance, i.e. - by spinning etc. The
voltages are thus determined for each race or for part of each race by
successive spinnings or variations in the setting of the ~~ po~~ rheostat. The
rheostat may be printed directly on the surface of the playing board for
convenience and manufacturing economy viz.

Sept. 5, 1951 A patent pertaining to toy vehicles and track has been applied
for, filed last week. Continuing with a description. January 15-1952 Since
starting this notebook, the inventor has ended his relationship with Mr. Edmond
Baggott of Ideal Toy Co. (re: page 3) who, in the writer's opinion, display bad
faith in copying for the company, an idea in toy mechanisms which the writer
disclosed to him in January 1951. For this reason the contents of this notebook
were not disclosed to Baggott. I now have two prospects to ~~ go to ~~ approach
to ~~ back ~~ finance the venture of getting some of these devices on the
market, one a Mr. Abramson president of Raylite Incorporated and the other, a
Mr. Arthur Ross whom the author recently met, is looking for a business to go
into. Fabricating & Manufacturing Techniques (continued) It is conceived that a
process similar to the "letter press" printing process could be utilized to
transfer a current conducting material such as a plastic to a non conducting
surface for the purpose Witnessed: May 22, 1952 Howard Lemelson

of fabricating the devices, toys and games described in this notebook. This
would involve the transfer of the molten plastic from a drum or plate to the
printing surface and to the surface of the object to be printed If a thermo
setting plastic is utilized it may be necessary to heat the printing plate
during operation to prevent ~~ ive ~~ the plastic from solidifying on the
printing surface or "cut" as it is commonly called in the printing (ink) field.
Design of Printing Machine (assuming that heating of printing drum is required)

Roller A transfers molten plastic (conducting) or metal to raised surface
elements of (cut) drum (B). Drum (B) is heated on the the inside by a gas heater
or electrical heater (D) and kept hot so that the plastic or metal will not
solidify on the drum. This plastic or metal is transferred from the raised
sections of drum (D) (E) to (over) Witnessed: Howard Lemelson, May 22, 1952

June 2-1952 I have just received copies of patents referred to in my first
office action to my patent on this topic. These I will turn over to my patent
attorney who will prepare a report of for Author Ross regarding patentability,
etc. Mr. Blum (my attorney) has been given a collection of drawings and
descriptions regarding conceptions of devices, manufacturing techniques, product
simplification, etc on this topic: These include a number of the ideas which
were shown diagramatically or discussed with Mr. Ross. Under manufacturing
techniques such things as automatic machinery for lubricating playing surfaces &
track (re: pp. 6, 7, etc of this book and a special report I prepared for Ross,
including possible methods for grinding; blasting, etc the surface of the track
to make the conductor adhere; techniques for making a cross over conductors;
etc. a technique for ~~ smoth ~~ smoothing a sprayed metal surface element to
(re. p. 11) which J. Lemelson June 6-52 Also not previously recorded was the
conception of spraying a conductor onto a relatively flexible sheet of

two objects which comprise a ~~ conduc ~~ non conducting base having conducting
elements coated or bonded thereto, I have already suggested in my patent
application #244557 and in my notes that the flexible qualities of the base be
utilized for the mechanical joining of the two elements or units and that the
conducting strips or elements be extended right into the area of contact of the
joined (flexed) pieces to continue the electrical circuit from one piece to the
other. Other means have been conceived for electrical joining of device of this
nature and, I will ~~ here ~~ now attempt to classify them in an orderly manner:
viz: Plug-in Connection: In my patent application I disclose how a male fitting
having a conducting layer extending thereon or partially there on may ~~ fitte
~~ be fitted into a cavity or hole having a conducting layer extending therein
from the surface to continue the circuit. ~~ viz ~~ this may be applied to a
device where it is desired to plug-in a wire or tip jack to extend or continue
the circuit. viz.

The flexible qualities of the plug-in or of the material of the ~~ plastic ~~
non-conducting base A may be utilized to hold the plug-in in place. The entire
hole and the immediate surrounding area may be coated with the conductor to
guarantee electrical contact. Snap-on Devices. In my pat application I showed
how the flexing qualities of the nonconducting base may be utilized to hold to
hold two units together & electrically join them. An embodiment of this could
be:

This device C may be an accessory unit pluggin in parallel on the playing board

Clips.- If clips are used to tie into the main line - ~~ a simp ~~ a conceivable
simple approach is to extend the line to the edge of the board & clip ~~ p ~~

Note: The general ideas ~~ of ~~behind the thoughts of the inventor are to
simplify the fabrication of these electrical devices with conducting layers
thereon to ~~ reduce ~~ eliminate the necessity of using fasteners, wires, or
other components which are usually necessary when the conventional methods of
electrical fabrication are employed, thus reducing cost. The general ideas are
two fold in considering the fabrication of devices in this category and
electrical devices which have conducting layers on a flexible non conductive
base which must be assembled and (or) disassembled by the user namely. (1)
Simplicity of fabrication by having but one molding operation followed by an
operation ~~ duri ~~ to apply the conducting layer(s). and. (2) Simple methods
for joining wherein the flexing qualities of the material are utilized and (or)
taper fits which may also utilize the flexing of the parts together with the
idea of bringing the coated layers or conducting elements

into the area of joining preferably actually coating of the male fittings and
the female cavities; over the edges, under the board, etc. Jerome Lemelson June
6-52 Witnessed & Understood By Helen Kuhn June 6, 1952 Howard Lemelson June 6,
1952 James Lemelson June 6-1952 September 18-1952 Called Mr. Arthur Ross a week
ago to request financial aid in purchase of equipment to make models. He claimed
he is not interested at the time being, due to other financial and business
obligations. Visited Metallizing Co. of 8-11 43rd Rd. Queens. And, after seeing
a demonstration of their metlalizing gun (metal spray gun) I intend to by buy
the research model. which will cost about $200-. Concerning the use of these
sprayed metal coating as conducting mediums I have

### Page 21
conceived of the following processing technique. The Schori, Mogul, etc. spray
systems provide a metallic coating on a base which has a surface roughness
proportional to the mesh of the powder used, or if wire is used, proportional to
the parameters of the process. In other words the spraying technique as
developed today do not afford a smooth finish. For toy or general electrical
applications of these thin metallic coatings where there is a sliding contact
between a brush and the coating on a base, this rough finish is undesirable as
it will tend to wear down the contactor or brush. A process is conceived in
which metal is prayed on a base (for toy track where the layer of metal serves
as the third rail and ground to conduct current to the toy vehicle) and the
resulting pattern is polished or buffed smooth as follows. (A) Technique "A" -
The metal is sprayed on a high surface such as a projecting rail

Sept 18, 1952 A mask M is placed first over the non-conducting base (B)
permitting only the rails R to project above the surface of the mask. The
conducting layer of metal (L) is then sprayed on. With the mask still in place
the layer L is then buffed, grinded or smoothed down by particle blasting. The
mask M is removed and the rails then have a conductive coating thereon forming a
complete ~~ cl~~ circuit when electircally connected with a power supply (B)
Technique B involves ~~the~~ preferably the use of a durable mask M over a
Technique B flat surface (B) spraying a layer of metal (L) on the surface of
(H); keeping the mask in place and passing over with a soft buffing wheel or
particle blasing to smooth down the surface of L while the mask is in place. The
mask is then removed and used again

### Page 22
or discarded, while the base (B) is not affected by the smoothing operation.
Note: If (B) is a thin plastic or other ~~ non-magnetic ~~ sheet, magnets may be
used on the underside of (B) to hold the mask (M) on, eleminating the necessity
of using an adhesive for the mask (mask must of course be made of a magnetic
material. Technique C.Use of thin metalic sheet bonded to base for conducting
element - 1 Thin metallic sheet (possibly .02 - .10" ~~ } ~~ thick) die stamped
to shape and held by a holding device employing suction means to hold it in
place, ~~ p ~~ or magnetic means if sheet is paramagnetic, prior to placing on
base of toy (which would preferably be plastic or paper) has been conceived as a
cheap means for applying the conducting element. If the base is thermoplastic
the ~~ sheet of ~~ metal pattern may be secured to said base by (a) use of
adhesives (b) by heating base just below pattern using electronic or radio heat
techniques (c) by induction heating the metal sheet causing the thermoplastic
material ~~ in contact ~~ of the base which is in contact with the strip to melt
and fuse with the strip.

(C) Utilizing plastics which are conductive sprayed on to a nonconducting
    plastic or paper base. I have experimented during the past two months with
    various plastics such as cellulose acetate, Krylon (acrylic base) Kylon (a
    cold setting plastic), vinyl base plastics, etc. all heavily loaded with
    carbon or a conducting mortor ~~ mar ~~ marketed by the Atlas Mineral
    Company called Conductoplast without success at low currents (and voltages
    ~~ 6 ~~ 1 1/2 to 6 volts.) I know that Chrysler Motors has a conducting
    plastic which is efficient at higher voltages. I intend to continue to
    experiment to obtain an efficient conducting plastic which preferably may be
    applied to a non conducting base by printing. Jerome Lemelson Sept 18, 1952
    Additional material Sept. 18, 1952 Light Bulb Socket as conceived some time
    ago in which sprayed metal or conducting medium is applied to a formed base
    (no assembly operations necessary) See the sketch on the next page.

    Bulk snaps in J Lemelson Sept 20, 52 September 20, 1952 Purchased a model
    "L" Schon powder pistol from Schoric process Corp. of L. A. City together
    with necessary equipt to spray aluminum & Zinc. Worked four hours at 1160
    Bway, Brooklyn trying to spray metal on various surfaces. There is not a
    good bond of zinc to plastic such as styrene unless the surface is very
    rough. The layer of metal that remains on after spraying easily scrapes off.
    I propose to prepare the surface of a plastic such as polystyrene or acetate
    by first applying a thinner or plasticized to the surface of the plastic and
    then while the plastic surface is still soft or molten, spraying on said
    coating of said metal or prepare the surface by particle blasting or crazing
    with a thinner.

Games employing conducting layers on non-conducting surfaces. The following
games were conceived over a year ago employing a pattern applied to a surface of
thin metallic sheeting or sprayed metal. The Toss Toys have been conceived in
which a metallic object such as a coin, etc. is tossed on a surface having a
conducting pattern thereon part of said pattern being separated ~~from sam ~~
electrically from the other half of said pattern, each half the positive and
ground of an electric current, a bell, light, buzzer or other device in series
with the power supplying, the pattern being so arranged on the surface that the
coin ~~which it ~~ when it falls on different positions on the board completes a
circuit involving each of the patterns the bell or light and the power supply or
battery thus actuating the lighted bell. This differs from an amusement device
(electrical) used in amusement parks in that the entire electrical pattern is on
one surface reducing the operations necessary to tie-in to the back of the
board. (over)

been working on a patent application for the past three months on the
embodyments of this notebook and expect to file it within the next week or so. A

surface upon which the wheels ride and contacting strips slide appears to work
best at present. There are conducting plastics which conceivably when sprayed on
a surface would blend with the base plastic or could be rolled on the surface to
form these strips. The preferable conceived method is to prepare the base by
forming or blasting to hold the conducting layer (note the board layout refered
to on p 16 wherein everything is applied to one playing surface including
switch, playing board, battery box, etc (the surface being formed with a vehicle
guiding means thereon) has also been built (last September) Item B in the Figure
at the top of p. 17 could conceivably be both an electrical device such as a
light, bell, etc in series with an electrical counter which would record the
number of times the ball struck the post or wall (p. 16.) The following game
device has also been conceived as a low cost approach to recording the passage
of a pin ball thru a hole in the playing board (or placement of a pinball in a
cavity or indentation in the playing surface). (a) Indentation in playing
surface

Ball rolls into cavity C. (over)

### Page 25
which has strips S1 & S2 extending therein said strips being extensions of an
electrical circuit being broken within the cavity C and spaced close together
therein so that a ball made of an electrically conducting material when rolled
into the cavity C and resting therein will complete the circuit causing the
light to flash on or a buzzer to ring, etc. The entire conducting strip layout
may be applied to the playing surface thus eliminating the need of costly
assembly operations which would be present if it were necessary to pass
conducting elements thru the board from the blind face or using connectors, etc.
B refers to the cavity backstop which may be formed integrally with the playing
surface. (B)

In this arrangement a hole is formed in the upper playing surface P1 and a lower
surface P2 is provided for blind return of the balls to the actuating mechanism
(not shown) Conducting strips S1 & S2 are patterened about P2 and brought close
together Jerome Lemelson 3/13/53 Witnessed by Howard Lemelson 3-13-53

near the vicinity of the holes so that the ball when it falls there the hole
will complete a circuit as it stripes P2. (Re:p.16) viz: strips (circuit is
completed as ball touches both strips at once The game shown on pp. 34,35 could
conceivably made into a magnetic toss game wherein the tossed object would be a
magnet and the conducting pattern a sheet of steel secured to the ~~c ~~on
conducting surface. The following game has been conceived.

above causes the object to move thereabouts, the object has means for completing
the electric circuit when it moves across the two separated strip segments. The

the circuit as it crosses the closely spaced strips. April 4, 1953 Scolite For
the record, as I seem to have missplace a self mailed letter recording the date
of conception of the following device I am herebye recording its conception and
reduction to practice I am working on a patent application covering the device
which I expect to have ready for filing in about a month. Fig. 1 Flashing or
Flickering Reflective Surfaces: The numeral 1 refers to a reflex- reflector
(possibly the type known commercially as Scotch Lite) Placed over the surface of
the sheet of Scotch Lite 1 is a plastic or clear glass sheet 2, the front
surface of which is formed with a series of indentations or cylindrical
projections 2, the clear surface of which is formed with a series of
indentations 4. A light beam passing thru 3 is reflected as

a cone of light back to the observer who is traveling with the light by the
reflex reflector 1. As the angle of the light beam charges, the returning light
is interferred with by the formations 3 and 4 causing it to flash or flicker off
until the light ~~ is ~~ again appears to the observer. Other forms of this
reflector and related advertising devices will be disclosed in my pending
application. This device was reduced to practice in January 1953 with the aid of
Mr. Robert Kraushaar, optical physicist of New York University. Jerome Lemelson

in which the arm rests by gravity in the groove of the record. Certain of my toy
designs such as the walkie-talkie may have to be played with the record rotating
about a horizontal axis. Others such as the vehicle mounted record player toys
may be easily jarred while playing and light spring biassing may be necessary to
assure continued operation. Sam Freimauer informed me that he intends to make
the groves of the records .003 to .005" deep to reduce possibility of the needle
coming out of the groove when played by gravity. (b) Another suggestion I made
to Sam Freimauer was that he extend one of the pins or shafts of the spring

Feb. 22, 1960 Subject - Solar Cigarette Lighter Using my Hobby Vac vacuum

several interesting product design capabilities. In the first place, the box
portion B surrounding the bowl or reflector portion A provides substantial
support to A permitting thinner material to be use. Secondly, if backed with a
sheet of cardboard or plastic C bonded to the flange B', the item may be
produced cheaply and the assembly may comprise part of the container for the
lighter. The following new ideas are conceived for mounting the cigarette holder
by cigarette holder viz Fig. 2

cigarette is supported not by the ~~pa ~~reflector section A of the plastic
sheet 10 but by the base sheet 12 to which it is riveted or adhered as in Fig.
3'. Wire form G holds the cigarette and plug into a hole H in F. The material of

START In Figs. 5 to 8 is shown the application of a flexible pull strip of the
type described for the quick and amplified opening of a pouring spout such as
the metal or plastic pouring spout generally provided on the upper portion of
the side-walls of paper cereal containers or containers of salt. Such spouts are
generally of the shape illustrated in Fig. 5 and consists of a metal U-shaped
stamping 34 having flat side-walls 34b and 34c of somewhat triangular shape and
a central ~~tro~~ wall ~~ or tro ~~ 34a forming a trough along which the powder
or granular material flows MW 9/20/60 THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ & UNDERSTOOD

wall of the container ~~ such as 32 in Fig.6 and paper is l ~~ as illustrated in
Fig.6 with the sides 34a and 34b of the spout 34 penetrating the wall of the box

and time consuming task if a sharp knife or razor blade is not available. In the
structure illustrated in Figs. 5 to 8 a plastic or foil pull strip is secured to
the spout and projects through a slit in the paper wrapped around the box in a
manner whereby it may be pulled by grasping between the thumb and forefinger and
will effect the outward floating of the spout to a pouring position MW 9/20/60

the problem of ultrasonic deburring he would be quite interested. I suggested
the possibility of either flowing particles or small pebbles of a hard THIS

December 2, 1960 I visited Pictorial Productions, Inc. 60 Kingsbridge Rd. East
Mt. Vernon, N.Y. today and talked to Mr. and Mrs. Anderson president and vice
president of the firm about my reflecting highway sign (lenticular) of my patent
no. entitled Reflecting Display Device. While at Pictorial Productions I
discussed with the Andersons. (a)My ideas for modular lenticular reflectors
which piece together to form a large sign. Discussed was a 12" x 12" unit in
which the edges are shaped to align each with the next module and to retain them
together. (b) The idea of extruding and printing on the rear face of the lends
sheet and THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ & UNDERSTOOD BY EJW DATE 12/18/60

applying reflective beads thereover (c) A lens sheet design in which the
lenticular surface is coated or covered with a transparent plastic material of a
different index of refraction than the material of the lends sheet itself. The
above ideas and others were discussed when they questioned me about the various
facets about applying my Reflecting Display Device to highway use. The Aldersons
agreed, that they would cooperate in the production of samples if I would
provide them with specifications and eetails of the designs of the sign. I also

Dec 2, 1960 Dock of Dock and Dock today to discuss my wipe cleaning and
polishing machine. While there, he showed me an application for a cup having a
food concentrate on the bottom (an idea which I had also conceived some time
ago) and said that he thought of also lining the wall of the cup with
concentrate. I discussed the technical aspects of this idea with him and made
certain suggestions which I had conceived, viz. (a) Coating by spray or rolling
on the food concentrate on the flat paper stock which is thereafter formed to
the shape of a cup. (b) stacking cups (one shaped) by folding and retaining apex
of each in a pocket THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ & UNDERSTOOD BY EJW DATE

formed of the wall of the below. (c) opening of folded cup in a machine prior to
admission of water, by automatically operated tongs which separate. While on the
subject of food, I also disclosed to M. Russel Dock ideas I had conceived for
the following. (1) Idea of injecting colorants and/or foods into fruits or
vegetables to improve their appearance and/or taste. For example, grapefruit or
oranges could have mashed pineapple or apple sauce or juices infected inside,
sugar or other flavor; apples could have center cored and filled with sugar,
syrup, candy, whipped cream, etc. THIS CONFIDENTIAL MATTER READ & UNDERSTOOD BY
