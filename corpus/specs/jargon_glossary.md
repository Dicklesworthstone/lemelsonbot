# Jargon Glossary — Lemelson Invention Method

```yaml
- term: Record of Conception
  short: Dated invention record establishing priority.
  long: A formal notebook entry that states the idea, its purpose, and intent to file.
    It anchors priority and gives later filings a clear evidentiary trail.
  analogy: Think of it like notarizing the birth of an idea.
  why: Lemelson repeatedly labels entries this way to lock in priority (§2, §20, §21).
  related: ["Witness", "Patent Link", "Disclosure Log"]
  category: methodology

- term: Witness
  short: Independent reader who confirms a disclosure.
  long: A witness signs and dates to indicate they read and understood the disclosure.
    This makes the record social and strengthens credibility.
  analogy: Like having a referee confirm what happened.
  why: Witness lines recur after disclosures (§11, §12, §19, §24).
  related: ["Record of Conception", "Disclosure Log"]
  category: methodology

- term: Disclosure Log
  short: Ledger of who saw what and under what terms.
  long: A concise record of external sharing—people, dates, and confidentiality terms.
    It protects IP and captures collaboration history.
  analogy: A guestbook for your invention.
  why: Lemelson tracks disclosures and agreements (§13, §16).
  related: ["Witness", "Prototype", "Licensing"]
  category: methodology

- term: Embodiment
  short: A specific implementation of the core idea.
  long: One concrete version of a mechanism among many possible variants.
    Embodiments anchor figures and claims.
  analogy: One recipe for a dish with many possible versions.
  why: Multiple embodiments broaden scope (§7, §14).
  related: ["Variant", "Figure Reference"]
  category: core

- term: Figure Reference
  short: Labeled diagram tied to text descriptions.
  long: A numbered figure that anchors a visual embodiment in the written record.
    It reduces ambiguity and supports patent language.
  analogy: A map legend that makes the map readable.
  why: Lemelson frequently ties text to figures (§14).
  related: ["Embodiment", "Patent Link"]
  category: methodology

- term: Variant
  short: Alternate embodiment, material, or application.
  long: A deliberate list of alternative forms to expand claim scope.
    Variants keep the invention flexible across markets.
  analogy: Different trims of the same car platform.
  why: Variants appear as explicit expansions (§7, §14).
  related: ["Embodiment", "Manufacturing Feasibility"]
  category: core

- term: Prototype
  short: Physical model of the idea.
  long: A tangible model used to validate feasibility and communicate with partners.
    Prototypes link ideas to manufacturing reality.
  analogy: A mockup before building a house.
  why: Models are shown to manufacturers and partners (§1, §17).
  related: ["Disclosure Log", "Manufacturing Feasibility"]
  category: core

- term: Manufacturing Feasibility
  short: Materials and processes needed to build the idea.
  long: The explicit statement of fabrication methods (molding, sealing, etc.).
    It keeps ideas grounded in production reality.
  analogy: Knowing the kitchen before writing the recipe.
  why: Molding and process notes recur (§20, §22).
  related: ["Molding", "Heat Seal", "Experiment Log"]
  category: methodology

- term: Molding
  short: Forming plastics into shapes via tooling.
  long: A general fabrication method; Lemelson often specifies slush or rotational molding.
  analogy: Casting clay in a reusable form.
  why: Molding methods appear in fabrication descriptions (§20).
  related: ["Slush Molding", "Rotational Molding"]
  category: domain

- term: Slush Molding
  short: Coating a mold interior with liquid plastic.
  long: A process where liquid plastic forms a hollow body by coating the mold interior.
  analogy: Swirling paint around a cup to coat it.
  why: Used in toy fabrication notes (§20).
  related: ["Molding", "Rotational Molding"]
  category: domain

- term: Rotational Molding
  short: Rotating a mold to distribute plastic evenly.
  long: A process where the mold rotates so plastic coats the interior uniformly.
  analogy: Spinning a salad spinner to spread dressing.
  why: Cited in toy and hollow body fabrication (§20).
  related: ["Molding", "Slush Molding"]
  category: domain

- term: Heat Seal
  short: Joining thin materials with heat.
  long: A sealing method used for packaging and thin plastic enclosures.
  analogy: Sealing a bag with a hot iron.
  why: Appears in packaging and enclosure descriptions (§14).
  related: ["Weld", "Packaging"]
  category: domain

- term: Weld
  short: Permanent material join via heat or pressure.
  long: A joining method for plastics or metals, often used where seals must be robust.
  analogy: Fusing two plastic straws into one.
  why: Listed as a joining approach in material notes (§22).
  related: ["Heat Seal", "Manufacturing Feasibility"]
  category: domain

- term: Patent Link
  short: Cross-reference to earlier filings or exhibits.
  long: A note that ties an entry to application numbers or exhibits to preserve lineage.
  analogy: Footnotes that show a chain of custody.
  why: Lemelson references prior filings (§4, §12).
  related: ["Record of Conception", "Figure Reference"]
  category: methodology

- term: Licensing
  short: Granting rights to manufacture or sell.
  long: Discussions of licensing are recorded alongside disclosure and prototype notes.
  analogy: Renting out the right to use your invention.
  why: Partner discussions and agreements recur (§13, §16).
  related: ["Disclosure Log", "Prototype"]
  category: core

- term: Experiment Log
  short: Record of tests and outcomes.
  long: Notes on material/process experiments, including results and implications.
  analogy: A lab notebook page for invention trials.
  why: Experiments are documented in the notebooks (§5, §8).
